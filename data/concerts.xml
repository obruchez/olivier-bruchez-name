    <comments>My 12<sup>th</sup> Yaron Herman concert and the 3<sup>rd</sup> one at the Temple in Cully. Fantastic concert. We were right behind Yaron (2 meters away?), so were able to see his hands "fly" on the keyboard. Impressive.</comments>

    <comments>I saw Brad almost one year before exactly at the same venue. The format was more or less the same, with maybe more original compositions than pop/rock songs this time. A very "generous" concert, like the previous one, with four encores.</comments>

    <comments>I've heard Cory Wong a lot on his YouTube channel. I discovered him in 2022, realizing that he was playing with two former Prince musicians (Sonny Thompson and Michael B. Nelson). I was a bit disappointed to see that Sonny was not part of the tour, but happy to finally see/hear Michael B. Nelson (he's kind of a legend to me, having heard him and/or his work so many times in Prince's music). I'm still not totally convinced by Cory's music, which is a bit too much pop/light to my ears, but there's definitely a lot of talent in the band.</comments>

    <comments>My 17<sup>th</sup> (!) Marcus Miller concert. This is the musician I've seen the most live. I hadn't seen him in 7 years. Nothing revolutionary, but the music is top-notch, as always. I didn't know any of the musicians playing with him. Tom Ibarra, in particular, is apparently not touring with Marcus. He's a 23-year-old guitar player who already played with Marcus in 2016.</comments>

    <comments>I saw this exact same band 6 years ago. There's not much to say: those musicians are all excellent. I was not a fan of Lionel Loueke before (especially with Herbie Hancock), but that night his sound didn't bother me. I actually liked a lot of what he did.</comments>

    <comments>This was the fourth time I saw Abdullah Ibrahim and the first time in 13 years. This was a beautiful concert, as is his last album. At 88 years old, I don't know if I'll see him live again (you never know). This made this concert even more special.</comments>

    <rating>3.5</rating>
    <comments>Overall, a very mainstream jazz concert. It sometimes felt like "hotel bar jazz". I was not convinced by Thomas Quasthoff's style/humor, which I found off-putting, like Médéric Collignon's scat singing last year. We attended this concert mainly because Bill Evans was there, but his presence is still somewhat of a mystery to me, as his skills were underused. Dieter Ilg's introduction solo to "Summertime" was really excellent. A nice (but a bit too conventional) version of "Jean-Pierre" was played.</comments>

    <comments>This was a short (45-minute?) concert for people who donated some money to the festival after it was cancelled in 2020. Not necessarily the kind of music I would listen to, but as a live performance, it was quite fascinating. It was a sonic as well as a visual experience.</comments>

    <comments>My first "real" concert in almost two years. Not really my cup of tea, but Andrina Bollinger has a lot of positive energy. It was an enjoyable concert. She's apparently a David Lynch fan and watched the whole Twin Peaks series last year (as she explained before a song inspired by Lynch). She gets a bonus point for that. :)</comments>

    <comments>I really like Chris Potter and Dave Holland. Zakir Hussain, which I also saw with Charles Lloyd, is a great musician, but I'm less impressed with his style. Overall, the playing was excellent, but I was probably not in the right mood to fully appreciate the music (which, without bass and drums, was a bit more laid-back, less energetic).</comments>

    <comments>A fantastic concert (and quite long as well - 130 minutes). I think I knew all the tunes. Samuel Laviso played like his life depended on it from start to finish. The encores included "Happy People", as usual, which always works. I heard a few very recognizable quotes ("Summertime", "Frère Jacques" (?), a tune by Coltrane, but also "Wrinkle" and another tune from Kenny's time with Miles).</comments>

    <comments>The last time I saw Neneh Cherry was with The Thing in 2012. Having excellent musicians with you is important. Her 2018 band is average-to-good, I would say. It's not really tight. Their sound worked better with the new songs (from <i>Broken Politics</i>, which is very good). As for older songs, "Manchild" and "I've Got You Under My Skin" were pretty good; "7 Seconds" didn't work (without Youssou N'Dour, I guess it can't); "Buffalo Stance" (?) was also average. I still had a good time, though (front row, Neneh often standing at less than one meter from me).</comments>

    <comments>I'm only familiar with a couple of White Stripes albums, which I like very much. The concert was good, but I'm wondering whether Jack White's sound doesn't work best in studio. Obviously, I don't know what I'm talking about and will listen to the rest of his discography soon...</comments>

    <comments>Mike Stern and Lenny White are two musicians who, again, played with Miles Davis (Mike Stern in 1981-83 and 1985-86, and Lenny White, on the <i>Bitches Brew</i> album). I had already seen Mike Stern with Bill Evans (another musician who played with Miles) in 2005. A good and fun concert. I don't think I'm a fan of the way Randy Brecker plays the trumpet, but there aren't many trumpet players I enjoy outside of Miles. I should probably give him another chance. All the musicians were good, though, especially Mike Stern, who has a very recognizable style.</comments>

Dave Liebman played with Miles Davis on the <i>On The Corner</i> album, on tracks such as "Calypso Frelimo" and "He Loved Him Madly", as well as on many concerts in 1973-74. I didn't know Billy Hart played with Miles Davis (on <i>On The Corner</i> and <i>Tutu</i>). This was what I would call "cerebral music" (not many melodies, a lot of dissonance, etc.). Overall, I liked Dave Liebman better than the other two sax players.</comments>

    <comments>If it wasn't for the music, my rating would be lower. Let's be honest: I had fun from start to finish, even if they're not the greatest musicians. Two conclusions: Prince's music, in itself, is great, but Prince was of course an important part of the equation. Anyway, I didn't expect much, so I was happy to be there. The New Power Generation was opening for Lauryn Hill, but there were a lot of Prince fans in the audience (hints: t-shirts, tatoos, etc.). The setlist was, I think, pretty much the same as at the other European concerts (7 songs from 1991-92 and 18 songs from 1980-90, if I'm correct). Mainly hits. Nothing from 1993-2016 (a real shame!). "Call the Law" was an excellent surprise (although, Mike Scott on the guitar is definitely not the same as Prince, of course). "Jughead" was fun. There was a moment of silence for John Blackwell just before "Purple Rain".</comments>

    <comments><i>Don Giovanni</i> opera (Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart), directed by Éric Vigié. Yet another famous opera that I didn't know. A lot of excellent singers. The sets in the second part were particularly impressive (the scenes with the Statue), yet quite simple. Some of the colors/lights effects were also simple but effective. After seeing Molière's <i>Dom Juan</i> at Théâtre de Vidy last year, it was intriguing to see Mozart / Lorenzo da Ponte's take on the Don Juan character.</comments>

    <comments>McCoy Tyner is a legend, but let's be honest: at 78, he's currently not at his best. He still has some energy left, but his playing is a bit patchy, to say the least. I must say that I was not completely comfortable seeing him like that (i.e. less than healthy, barely able to walk and speak). I was far more impressed by Wayne Shorter's concert last year, for example (he was 82 at the time). Anyway, the concert consisted of three parts, each with a single piano player (Craig Taborn came first, then Geri Allen, and finally McCoy Tyner, who played for about 30 minutes).</comments>

    <comments>This was the third time I saw Colin Vallon, but I can't say I'm really familiar with his music, which is quite melodic, sometimes based on repetitive, almost funky riffs. I had already seen Patrice Moret a lot at Le Bout du Monde, a bar with a small concert room in Vevey, back in 2006. This was the second time I saw him with Colin Vallon. This was also the third time I saw Julian Sartorius and the first two times were solo performances (drums only), which were enjoyable but didn't particularly convince me. I liked him way better in the context of this trio. So, yes, musicians I had already seen quite a few times, but that I don't really know. I think I'm going to buy Colin Vallon's latest album, "Danse". We'll see.</comments>

There were many good moments during the concert, as well as far more average moments. With 11 musicians on stage, never all at the same moment, it was to be expected. "A Taste of Honey", with Piers Faccini on vocals, was one of the highlights, for me.</comments>

    <comments><i>La Bohème</i> opera (Giacomo Puccini), directed by Claude Stratz. This was my fourth opera at the Opéra de Lausanne. As usual, I didn't know anything about the work (let's say I wanted to have a fresh, neophyte perspective - but I'm a bit lazy as well...). The first two acts (before the intermission) are very happy. Almost mushy. The last two acts are a bit more dramatic. The very end of the fourth act is really designed to make you cry. The main themes are quite common, a bit clichés: the poor artist, love at first sight, happiness in poverty, etc. The music is easy to follow. Overall, I really liked the simple (but not pared-down) set and the singers were very good. Some of the longer "monologues" got a lot of applause from the audience.</comments>
