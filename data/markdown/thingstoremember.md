# Things to remember

## Nespresso orders/delivery (Swiss Post vs DPD)

* when ordering before 12 PM (noon), parcel should be delivered via Swiss post
* if delivered via DPD, parcel will not be delivered to a My Post 24 or Pickpost location
* this rule of thumb might work for other online merchants as well
