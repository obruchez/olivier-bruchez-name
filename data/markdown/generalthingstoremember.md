# General things to remember

##Â Learning

* "instead of sticking to one study location, simply alternating the room where a person studies improves retention"
* see [Forget What You Know About Good Study Habits](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/07/health/views/07mind.html)

## Nespresso orders/delivery (Swiss Post vs DPD)

* when ordering before 12 PM (noon), parcel should be delivered via Swiss post
* if delivered via DPD, parcel will not be delivered to a My Post 24 or Pickpost location
* this rule of thumb might work for other online merchants as well
