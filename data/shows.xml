    <comments>I'm liking this show more and more. I just realized that they're currently showing season 9. That's a lot of seasons. I hope they're not "milking the cow".</comments>

    <comments>As said in January 2017 when we finished the first season, we're watching "the other seasons". I probably enjoyed the second season more than the first one, so this is a good sign. Again (like <i>This Is Us</i>), it's not one of my favorite shows (yet), but it's not too far behind.</comments>

    <comments>I'm not a huge fan of this show, but it has its charms. I cried a few times. It's sometimes funny. I wouldn't say it's edgy, but it's not corny either (except maybe a couple of times). Let's see where it goes with season 2.</comments>

    <comments>Again, a fantastic show (I'm repeating myself, here). Season 3 was more fast-paced than season 2. It was very dark/depressing, as usual. My only complaint would be that there were maybe a little too many twists and turns. I'm relieved that the show is not going the "<i>Lost</i> way" (yet), though, i.e. using paranormal and time travel to explain things.</comments>

    <comments>A fun show. Matt LeBlanc playing Matt LeBlanc was an excellent idea, at least in 2011. Then it kind of lost its charm over the years, so it's a good thing this is the final series/season, even if I enjoyed it, overall.</comments>

    <comments>This is simply the most fantastic "TV show" I've seen in a long time. I use quotes, because this is actually like an 18-hour movie. Pure David Lynch from start to finish. Entire books could be written about this season and about some of the episodes in particular (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_8_(Twin_Peaks)">"Part 8"</a> is a mini-movie in itself).</comments>

    <comments>I haven't commented on the first three seasons, so I'll make my general comments here. <i>Bob's Burgers</i> is a kind of mix between a more edgy version of <i>The Simpsons</i> and a more family-friendly version of <i>South Park</i>. The voice acting is excellent and is a huge part of the show. At the moment, it's one of my favorite comedy animation shows.</comments>

    <comments>This season was about social networks, virtual reality, autonomous drones, hacking, online blackmail, mind uploading, etc. Overall, a very dark season. The last episode, in particular, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hated_in_the_Nation_(Black_Mirror)"><i>Hated in the Nation</i></a>, was terrifying. Let's be honest, it's something that could happen in the future. This is why some people think the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_control_problem">AI control problem</a> is so important.</comments>

    <comments>This was a short season (only seven episodes) and season 8 "is expected to premiere in late 2018/early 2019" only. The fact that season 2 of <i>Westworld</i> apparently won't start before spring 2018 is also a bit frustrating. Anyway, these are impressive shows and I understand that they take time to produce. Season 7 of <i>Game of Thrones</i> was quite intense. As always, important characters got killed. It goes without saying. Now I'm really curious about what will happen in season 8, because, at this point, it looks quite predictable.</comments>

    <comments>I started watching this short season (7 episodes) in 2011 and then completely stopped for six years. I don't know if I'm completely convinced yet, but this show is highly regarded (currently "Top Rated TV #63" on IMDb), so I'll probably try and watch season 2.</comments>

    <comments>What a fantastic, weird, sometimes dark show! The first season was quite normal in comparison with the second one. There were a few "David Lynch" moments (the scenes with the little girl, the fish, etc.). I hope the show won't end up being disapppointing, like <i>Lost</i> after a few seasons. I can't wait for season 3, obviously!</comments>

    <comments>Hackers, mental illness, conspiracies, revolution. A lot of interesting themes in this show. I first heard colleagues mention this show. After hearing Tamler and David from the Very Bad Wizards podcast talk about it, I knew I <em>had</em> to watch it! And it didn't disappoint.</comments>

    <comments>A great show and a good season. Yes, it's not always very realistic (unlike <i>Mr. Robot</i>, where you can regularly see snippets of code being written on the screen), but this is a comedy, after all, so exaggerations are expected. Virtual reality, deep learning, decentralized protocols, etc. are common themes, though, so it's still a sophisticated show (unlike <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>...).</comments>

    <comments>An excellent series. Very Roald Dahlesque. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Riddle_of_the_Sphinx_(Inside_No._9)"><i>The Riddle of the Sphinx</i></a> was one the best episodes, but it was also surprinsingly really dark. I'm really glad to read that a fourth series will be produced.</comments>

    <comments>Ok, let's be honest: I only watch <em>The Big Bang Theory</em> out of habit. At this point, it's less enjoyable than the last seasons of either <em>Friends</em> or <em>How I Met Your Mother</em>.</comments>

    <comments><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Right_Back">"Be Right Back"</a> is thought-provoking, because (at least in my opinion), it's something that will really happen at some point in the near future (at least the part with the chatbot). Ray Kurzweil is planning to do it with his father. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Bear_(Black_Mirror)">"White Bear"</a> was a bit more Twilight Zone-ish and disturbing. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Waldo_Moment">"The Waldo Moment"</a> was the weakest of the three episodes. I guess this is a reminder that most people don't seriously care about politics. We currently have Donald Trump, Brexit, and other instances of populism as evidence for that. Overall, it's still a good show. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Christmas_(Black_Mirror)">"White Christmas"</a> special episode was particularly good. The part about artificial intelligence torture/slavery was really disturbing (because it could become a real).</comments>

    <comments>A lot of known actors in this show, obviously (from <em>Seinfeld</em>, <em>Arrested Development</em>, etc.). For a non-native English speaker such as me, the show is a little bit difficult to follow (more than most shows), but I like it. The theme of the show is also quite original (politics in Washington, D.C.).</comments>

    <comments>What a original show! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louie_(TV_series)"><i>Louie</i></a> was already one of my favorite shows (it's funny, poetic, absurd, and, yes, sometimes vulgar, all at the same time). <i>Horace and Pete</i> definitely comes from the same man. It's a show, yes, a web series, to be more accurate, but it's also like a filmed stage play and, at times, like a movie (the scene with Laurie Metcalf is absolutely brilliant). I don't know what a second season would look like, but this is already a show I would recommend.</comments>
