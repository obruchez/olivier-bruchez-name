    <comments>It's weird to watch a TV show from 1959. After each episode, I have a look at the actors' entries on IMDb. 95% of the time, they're dead. The story of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0122519/">Terry Burnham</a>, in particular, aged 11 when she played in "Nightmare as a Child", is tragic. Anyway, <i>The Twilight Zone</i> is the kind of shows you have to watch with a different mindset. If you don't, it will look naive and simplistic.</comments>

    <comments>Like many people I guess, we watched this miniseries right after the end of <i>Game of Thrones</i>. It's excellent. Although probably overrated (currently <a href="https://www.imdb.com/chart/toptv">Top Rated TV #1</a> on IMDb).</comments>

    <comments>There are still a few funny moments here and there. My biggest problem with the show are the lame subplots (which usually involve Haley) and the bad and/or child actors (Gloria, Lily, and Joe). At this point, the show is still stronger than <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>'s last seasons.</comments>

    <comments>C'est une série britannique que j'ai dû voir sur la Télévision Suisse Romande (TSR) fin 1985 ou fin 1986 (la chaîne l'a diffusée deux fois). Je m'en souvenais vaguement (un coffret permettant de changer de taille et de voler), mais n'ai retrouvé son nom que très récemment. A l'époque, c'était une série que je trouvais vraiment "magique". Je me suis prêté à une expérience pour voir ce qui restait de cette magie 32 ou 33 ans plus tard, en regardant une version doublée en français (pour être au plus proche de ce que j'avais vu à l'époque) et de piètre qualité (vieille VHS) sur YouTube. Résultat des courses : c'est globalement assez niais. Certainement que le doublage <i>cheap</i> n'aide pas, mais une série comme <i>The Tripods</i>, dans un autre style mais également produite par la BBC à la même époque, a définitivement mieux vieilli, malgré ses défauts.</comments>

    <comments>I wrote that the previous season was "very dark", but this one is, I think, even darker. The theme of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_consciousness">artificial consciousness</a> and "artificial torture/hell" is present in several episodes: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Callister">"USS Callister"</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_the_DJ_(Black_Mirror)">"Hang the DJ"</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Museum_(Black_Mirror)">"Black Museum"</a>. It was also present in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Christmas_(Black_Mirror)">"White Christmas"</a> in 2014. It's a fascinating topic and I think it's a good thing that it can be popularized in such a way. In "Hang the DJ", an intriguing idea is introduced: artificial intelligence/consciousness agents in a simulation, not realizing that they're in a simulation. Of course, <i>Matrix</i> did it first, but here the simulation is "pure" (i.e. there are no "real" bodies anywhere). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile_(Black_Mirror)">"Crocodile"</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metalhead_(Black_Mirror)">"Metalhead"</a> (autonomous weapons, post-apocalyptic world) were particularly stress-inducing.

    <comments>One of my favorite animated shows. It tackles at lot of philosophical themes, some of them rather negative (absurdism, nihilism, etc.), some of them intriguing (personal identity, etc.). The framework of (infinite) parallel universes is an ideal way to explore those themes, I think, since it puts "our world" into perspective. <a href="https://www.google.ch/search?q=philosophy+of+rick+and+morty">Many articles</a> have been written about it. What's also interesting to me is that all those serious themes are treated with (dark) humor, which is refreshing.</comments>

    <comments>As said in January 2017 when we finished the first season, we're watching "the other seasons". I probably enjoyed the second season more than the first one, so this is a good sign.

    <comments>I'm not a huge fan of this show, but it has its charms. I cried a few times. It's sometimes funny. I wouldn't say it's edgy, but it's not corny either (except maybe a couple of times). Let's see where it goes with season 2.</comments>

    <comments>Again, a fantastic show (I'm repeating myself, here). Season 3 was more fast-paced than season 2. It was very dark/depressing, as usual. My only complaint would be that there were maybe a little too many twists and turns. I'm relieved that the show is not going the "<i>Lost</i> way" (yet), though, i.e. using paranormal and time travel to explain things.</comments>

    <comments>I haven't commented on the first three seasons, so I'll make my general comments here. <i>Bob's Burgers</i> is a kind of mix between a more edgy version of <i>The Simpsons</i> and a more family-friendly version of <i>South Park</i>. The voice acting is excellent and is a huge part of the show. At the moment, it's one of my favorite comedy animation shows.</comments>

    <comments>This season was about social networks, virtual reality, autonomous drones, hacking, online blackmail, mind uploading, etc. Overall, a very dark season. The last episode, in particular, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hated_in_the_Nation_(Black_Mirror)">"Hated in the Nation"</a>, was terrifying.

    <comments>This was a short season (only seven episodes) and season 8 "is expected to premiere in late 2018/early 2019" only. The fact that season 2 of <i>Westworld</i> apparently won't start before spring 2018 is also a bit frustrating. Anyway, these are impressive shows and I understand that they take time to produce. Season 7 of <i>Game of Thrones</i> was quite intense. As always, important characters got killed. It goes without saying. Now I'm really curious about what will happen in season 8, because, at this point, it looks quite predictable.</comments>

    <comments>What a fantastic, weird, sometimes dark show! The first season was quite normal in comparison with the second one. There were a few "David Lynch" moments (the scenes with the little girl, the fish, etc.). I hope the show won't end up being disapppointing, like <i>Lost</i> after a few seasons.

    <comments>A great show and a good season. Yes, it's not always very realistic (unlike <i>Mr. Robot</i>, where you can regularly see snippets of code being written on the screen), but this is a comedy, after all, so exaggerations are expected. Virtual reality, deep learning, decentralized protocols, etc. are common themes, though, so it's still a sophisticated show (unlike <i>The Big Bang Theory</i>...).</comments>

    <comments>Ok, let's be honest: I only watch <em>The Big Bang Theory</em> out of habit. At this point, it's less enjoyable than the last seasons of either <em>Friends</em> or <em>How I Met Your Mother</em>.</comments>

    <comments>I don't have much more to say about this show. I would say season 3 is slightly better than season 2 (more "action" and more twists). I'm not sure I know where it can go from there, though.</comments>

    <comments><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Right_Back">"Be Right Back"</a> is thought-provoking, because (at least in my opinion), it's something that will really happen at some point in the near future (at least the part with the chatbot). Ray Kurzweil is planning to do it with his father. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Bear_(Black_Mirror)">"White Bear"</a> was a bit more Twilight Zone-ish and disturbing. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Waldo_Moment">"The Waldo Moment"</a> was the weakest of the three episodes. I guess this is a reminder that most people don't seriously care about politics. We currently have Donald Trump, Brexit, and other instances of populism as evidence for that. Overall, it's still a good show. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Christmas_(Black_Mirror)">"White Christmas"</a> special episode was particularly good. The part about artificial intelligence torture/slavery was really disturbing (because it could become a real).</comments>

    <comments>A lot of known actors in this show, obviously (from <em>Seinfeld</em>, <em>Arrested Development</em>, etc.). For a non-native English speaker such as me, the show is a little bit difficult to follow (more than most shows), but I like it. The theme of the show is also quite original (politics in Washington, D.C.).</comments>

    <comments>What a original show! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louie_(TV_series)"><i>Louie</i></a> was already one of my favorite shows (it's funny, poetic, absurd, and, yes, sometimes vulgar, all at the same time). <i>Horace and Pete</i> definitely comes from the same man. It's a show, yes, a web series, to be more accurate, but it's also like a filmed stage play and, at times, like a movie (the scene with Laurie Metcalf is absolutely brilliant). I don't know what a second season would look like, but this is already a show I would recommend.</comments>
