# Animal Farm (George Orwell)
* After much choking, during which his various chins turned purple, he managed to get it out: “If you have your lower animals to contend with,’ he said, “we have our lower classes!’ This bon mot set the table in a roar; and Mr. Pilkington once again congratulated the pigs on the low rations, the long working hours, and the general absence of pampering which he had observed on Animal Farm.
