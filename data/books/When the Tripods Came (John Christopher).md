# When the Tripods Came (John Christopher)
* Andy said, "I read somewhere that by trying to kill them, men have actually improved the intelligence of rats." (loc. 1419-20)
* Tourism was a thing of the past, along with parliaments and television chat shows, universities and churches, human disorder and human freedom. (loc. 1432-33)
* Who could tell what wonders might still have lain ahead? But now, thanks to the Tripods, it had all ended. (loc. 1455-56)
