# Life, the Universe and Everything (Douglas Adams)
* Time is the worst place, so to speak, to get lost in, as Arthur Dent could testify, having been lost in both time and space a good deal. At least being lost in space kept you busy. (loc. 5864-5865)
* Only twenty minutes ago he had decided he would go mad, and now here he was already chasing a Chesterfield sofa across the fields of prehistoric Earth. (loc. 6065-6066)
* Arthur felt happy. He was terribly pleased that the day was for once working out so much according to plan. Only twenty minutes ago he had decided he would go mad, and now here he was already chasing a Chesterfield sofa across the fields of prehistoric Earth. (loc. 6065-6066)
* Ford was beginning to behave rather strangely, or rather not actually beginning to behave strangely but beginning to behave in a way that was strangely different from the other strange ways in which he more regularly behaved. (loc. 6179-6180)
* Suddenly Arthur remembered that the Earth was going to be demolished again in two days’ time, and just this once didn’t feel too bad about it. (loc. 6202-6203)
* Arthur lay in startled stillness on the acceleration couch. He wasn’t certain whether he had just got space-sickness or religion. (loc. 6367-6368)
* He could tell that he hadn’t met the creature before from the simple fact that he was able to sleep at nights. (loc. 7329-7330)
* Rule Six: The winning team shall be the first team that wins. (loc. 7548-7548)
* It is a mistake to think you can solve any major problems just with potatoes. (loc. 7894-7895)
* He hoped and prayed that there wasn’t an afterlife. Then he realized there was a contradiction involved here and merely hoped that there wasn’t an afterlife. (loc. 8452-8453)
