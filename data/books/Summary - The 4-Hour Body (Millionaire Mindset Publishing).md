# Summary - The 4-Hour Body (Millionaire Mindset Publishing)
* The Minimum Effective Dose, or MED, is simply described as "the smallest dose that will produce a desired outcome." Anything beyond the MED is considered a waste of time and effort. (loc. 122-123)
* So what is the MED for physical exercise? 80 SECONDS. For a particular muscle group (i.e. shoulders), activating the local growth mechanism requires just 80 seconds of tension using 50 pounds once a week, for example. (loc. 135-136)
* A decent method that you follow is better than the perfect method that you quit. (loc. 158-159)
* The Slow-Carb Diet (loc. 239-239)
* Eat the same meals over and over again. (loc. 246-247)
* Avoid "white" carbohydrates. (loc. 244-244)
* Avoid beverage calories. (loc. 250-250)
* Limit your fruit consumption. (loc. 254-254)
* Take one day off per week. (loc. 257-258)
* For optimal results, consume 30 grams of protein within 30 minutes of waking. (loc. 294-295)
* Eating too late, not consuming enough protein, and not drinking enough water are the most common mistakes. (loc. 288-288)
* Overusing artificial sweeteners, like aspartame and agave nectar. Although they are calorie-free, studies show that they promote insulin spikes and metabolism ruptures. (loc. 308-310)
* L-glutamine. This is used as a supplement post-workout to hasten tissue repair and minimize muscle soreness. (loc. 543-544)
* Creatine monohydrate. It hastens "both maximal force production and protein synthesis." (loc. 546-547)
* PROTOCOL #1: LONG-TERM AND SUSTAINED Fermented cod liver oil + vitamin-rich butter fat—2 capsules upon waking and before bed  Vitamin D3—3,000–5,000 IU upon waking and before bed (6,000–10,000 IU per day)  Short ice baths and/or cold showers—10 minutes each, upon waking and before bed  Brazil nuts—3 upon waking, 3 before bed. (loc. 630-637)
* Eat +800 milligrams of cholesterol (e.g. four large whole eggs) within three hours of bedtime. (loc. 640-641)
* Drinking 200 milligrams of the drug huperzine-A at most 30 minutes before going to bed. (loc. 685-686)
* Having low blood glucose levels before bed increases the chance of waking up groggy and irritable. (loc. 693-694)
* Set 67-70 degrees Fahrenheit (19.4-21.1 degrees Celsius) as your bedroom temperature. (loc. 700-701)
* Eat a large fat- and protein-rich meal three hours before bedtime. (loc. 703-704)
* Contrary to common belief, cold water is a better trigger to induce sleep than hot water. (loc. 711-712)
* Cycles of 5-10 gram of creatine monohydrate (cost: $20 per month). Recently, this drug was found to minimize or prevent the development of nervous system illnesses, specifically Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases. However, do not use creatine if you have kidney problems. (loc. 1105-1107)
* Intermittent fasting (IF) and protein cycling (cost: free). (loc. 1108-1109)
* Protein cycling. Restricting protein once per week up to at most 5% of the total calories consumed may help for fat loss and longevity. (loc. 1115-1115)
* Bloodletting. Not only does help improve insulin sensitivity; it also cleanses your body from toxins and free radicals since your body would be forced to make new red blood cells to compensate on the blood lost during the activity. (loc. 1117-1119)
