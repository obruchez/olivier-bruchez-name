        <comments>We visited this museum to see if it would be suitable for a school trip. It's very well done, but, at the end of the day, it's a museum dedicated to one of the largest food companies in the world.</comments>

        <name>Hieronymus Bosch and His Pictorial World in the 16th and 17th century / Permanent exhibition</name>
        <museum>Gemäldegalerie, Berlin, Germany</museum>
        <rating>5.25</rating>
        <comments>I absolutely love this kind of museums: lots of rooms, lots of paintings. I could stay entire days there. Hieronymus Bosch is one of my favorite painters. His style is so unique. Not many original paintings of his, but several copies. I unfortunately missed the exhibition at the Het Noordbrabants Museum in 2016, which would have been a lot better, obviously.</comments>

        <name>The Heritage of the Old Kings. Ctesiphon and the Persian Sources of Islamic Art / Permanent exhibition</name>
        <museum>Pergamonmuseum, Berlin, Germany</museum>
        <rating>5.0</rating>
        <comments>I don't know why, but I didn't appreciate this museum as much as I should have. I already visited it in 2009. The architectural reconstructions are impressive, but I was less impressed by the rest of the museum (and the temporary exhibition in particular - lots of texts to read, I was probably too tired...).</comments>

        <name>All about GOLEM! / Eran Shakine. A Muslim, a Christian and a Jew / Permanent exhibition</name>
        <museum>Jewish Museum, Berlin, Germany</museum>
        <rating>5.0</rating>
        <comments>I didn't know anything about the golem concept, so that temporary exhibition was instructive. The "A Muslim, a Christian and a Jew" exhibition was fun and easy to appreciate. We didn't spend a lot of time in the permanent exhibition part, as we already visited that museum in 2009. An important museum. Architecturally unique.</comments>

        <comments>The temporary exhibition about science-fiction movies was really well done. The rest of the museum is also really worth a visit. The starting room, with the mirrors, is a lot of fun.</comments>

        <rating>4.75</rating>
        <comments>Contemporary art is sometimes baffling. A good thing I liked to be baffled. I was not always impressed by the temporary exhibitions, but they were not bad either. I like the main hall of the museum. It's huge. And almost empty.</comments>
