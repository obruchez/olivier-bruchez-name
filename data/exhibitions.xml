        <comments>The first exhibition at Fondation Pierre Gianadda since Léonard Gianadda died (is it the last one he organized himself?). I had not seen the previous Anker exhibition. I really liked this one.</comments>

        <comments>My first time at the Espace des inventions, with our 5-year-old son, along with some friends of ours and their children. A really nice place for children. And for adults as well! We had the opportunity to see a small demo of a Boston Dynamics dog. Quite impressive.</comments>

        <comments>This was an overwhelming experience. There were too many visitors, so that was not pleasant at all. The number of items on display is completely incredible. You don't really know where to focus your attention. This was a visit that really made me realize that I prefer art museums and paintings in particular.</comments>

        <comments>It's important to understand and remember that sending a letter accross the world, less than a century ago, was something completely crazy and difficult. At least sometimes. Courageous people risked their lives. Now, of course, you just send an email or a WhatsApp message, but there's less adventure in the process.</comments>

        <comments>We've only seen a small part of the Cité de l'Espace, as it's quite big. The presentation of the Mars rovers was particularly well done. Also the part about the new Moon missions, explaining how human beings will be able to live on the Moon, etc., was interesting for adults, as well as for our 4-year-old son. We live exciting times and the exhibit managed to convey that.</comments>

        <comments>We already visited Les Machines de l'Île and the Grand Éléphant in Nantes in 2020. That was already a fantastic experience. The Minotaur is breathtaking as well and we had the opportunity to see the Dragon Horse before it's going back to China. That was an incredible experience.</comments>

        <rating>5.0</rating>
        <comments>We only had the time to visit the permanent exhibition, including a section dedicated to Böcklin, which I really liked. The last time we visited the museum, in 2010, the Neubau building didn't exist (it was inaugurated in 2016). I also really liked the "20<sup>th</sup> century / classic modernism" part of the Hauptbau.</comments>

        <museum>Fondation Beyeler, Basel, Switzerland</museum>
        <rating>4.25</rating>
        <comments>I really like some of the artists presented (Braque, Cézanne, Ernst, Giacometti, van Gogh, Miró, etc.), but too many of the paintings fell into the "single-color-or-single-line" category for my taste. We'll probably come back to the Fondation Beyeler, but we'll choose the exhibition a bit more carefully.</comments>

        <comments>We watched a good part of <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maso_et_Miso_vont_en_bateau"><i>Maso et Miso vont en bateau</i></a>. The original TV show, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHxBmO8A6YY"><i>Encore un jour et l'année de la femme, ouf ! C'est fini</i></a>, would probably be unthinkable nowadays and this is a good thing. We also spent 10-15 minutes listening to an interview with an anonymous woman. This is the kind of exhibitions that ask quite a lot of effort from the visitor.</comments>

        <rating>4.5</rating>
        <comments>This might seem like a cliché, but I love Van Gogh. I've seen his paintings in Amsterdam and in various museums around the world. Seing them in a "multimedia experience" (whatever that means in 2021) is not the same as seing paintings on the walls of a museum, but it's nevertheless a good way to discover them. Everything was not perfect (the sound, in particular, could have been better), but this form of experimental museology is probably the way to go. In my opinion, art is best experienced in a dedicated physical space, but there are various ways to do it. Technology can help and I hope to see other similar experiences in the future.</comments>

        <rating>4.75</rating>
        <comments>A painter I didn't know. We spent more time on his most well-known paintings, among which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Pont_de_l%27Europe"><i>Le Pont de l'Europe</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_raboteurs_de_parquet"><i>Les raboteurs de parquet</i></a>, but I liked his landscape paintings as well, such as <i>Avenue de la Villa des Fleurs à Trouville</i>, maybe because I saw the Hans Emmenegger exhibition a couple of weeks before.</comments>

        <comments>I wasn't familiar with Hans Emmenegger at all. I really liked his paintings of forest interiors. And it can seem weird, but his paintings of snow melting were also intriguing. I guess when you're a good painter, you can paint anything and still trigger strong emotions in the viewer.</comments>

        <rating>4.75</rating>
        <comments>I was ready to be completely confused, but I enjoyed this exhibition, thanks to our guide. It has a link with meditation (walking meditation, at least).

I think most if not all videos I saw are available online, but it's different to see them in a special context such as a museum. You give them more attention.</comments>

        <comments>It's hard to rate such a small exhibition. It's basically ten lithographs (edition 12 our of 30), one original lithography stone, a small video by David Lynch about the lithography process in Paris, a couple of pictures of David Lynch working on lithography stones (or metal plates?), and the <i>David Lynch: The Art Life</i> documentary, which I had already seen in 2017. I was probably the only visitor that day.</comments>

        <comments>Exhibition located a the top of the Mauvoisin Dam. "Charrière's new work traces the historical and geographical path between Mount Tambora in Indonesia, which erupted in 1815, and the Alps. It follows the entangled threads of climate devastation, monocultural farming, and an imaginary in which apocalyptic ecological threats find poetic utterance in the aesthetic of the sublime." Yes: the sublime; Charrière's photos are simply beautiful. There's a link between the <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1815_eruption_of_Mount_Tambora">1815 eruption of Mount Tambora</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gi%C3%A9tro_Glacier">1818 Giétro Glacier catastrophe</a>, which makes those photos even more poignant.</comments>

        <comments>We spent a bit more than an hour and a half in this museum. It was more impressive than the Richard H.

The collection itself (paintings) was moderately interesting, but the audio guide was very well done and I enjoyed the visit. Some of the paintings were from famous artists (Degas, Manet, Monet), but most of them were from artists that were unknown to me.</comments>

        <comments>We started with the highlights tour. The guide was really nice and her explanations were really easy to understand (i.e. not too technical). One hour and seven pieces of art later, we started a proper tour of a rather small subset of the museum. We went to the Roof Garden (<i>The Theater of Disappearance</i> special exhibit), the Greek and Roman Art section (statues, etc.), the Modern and Contemporary Art section, the 19<sup>th</sup>- and Early 20<sup>th</sup>-Century European Paintings and Sculpture section, and, finally, the European Paintings, 1250-1800 section (a lot more quickly, just before the museum closed). More than six hours in this fantastic museum was still not enough to see everything. Definitely one of the best museums I've ever visited.</comments>

        <comments>I really liked this museum, even though, as I already wrote for the Yūshūkan War Memorial Museum entry, I'm not a fan of history. It contains a good mix of texts, documents, and videos. It presents an American point of view, of course, but it's probably way less controversial than the Yūshūkan War Memorial Museum. Some of the topics were more sensitive (racism, treatment of the minority groups, and, in particular, of the Japanese Americans, etc.), but presented in a transparent way. The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were, I think, presented in a sufficiently detailed way (it's difficult to say what a "neutral" point of view would look like...). I realized I really don't know much about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_War">Pacific War</a> (I didn't even know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Darwin">Australia was bombed during the war</a>...). We spent three hours in the museum, but it was not enough. Unfortunately, we had to go a bit faster through the "Road to Tokyo" and "Road to Berlin" exhibits.</comments>

        <comments>A very nice museum, for children and adults. The omnipresence of wax figures gives the place a special touch. They're sometimes almost disturbing, especially when you don't realize right away that they're not visitors. There is a nice balance between the texts to read, the movies to watch, and the movie sets to visit. The Champ de Ban Estate Manor is also interesting. The bathroom with Einstein in front of the mirror is a funny experience. It's a symbol of the whole museum/manor, in a way.</comments>

        <comments>A lot of landscapes, particularly mountains by Hodler. Maybe a bit too much for my taste, even though some of them are excellent. Some familiar views around Lake Geneva. A couple of fantastic paintings by Monet and Munch.</comments>

        <comments>It looks like a huge library with about 300'000 manga books, magazines, and other items. As a complete neophyte when it comes to mangas, I found it a little disconcerting (this time in a bad way). The central room had a lot of explanations that were interesting and fun to read, though.</comments>

        <comments>Not really a museum, but a gallery, with 15-20 small rooms / temporary exhibitions, most of them by students or artists trying to get known. I was not particularly impressed by the paintings, drawings, etc. in themselves, but going into a small room, where the artist is present, looking at her/his art in front of her/him, and repeating the experience many times is a disconcerting experience (in a good way, if that makes sense).</comments>

        <rating>5.0</rating>
        <comments>This is a museum for children and adults. Many, many small things to see (drawings, in particular, books, photos, etc.). Isao Takahata's personal photos from his trip to Switzerland in the 70s were quite funny. The museum is not too big and probably always almost full, so some rooms were very crowded and definitely less pleasant to visit. I was a bit disappointed to learn that not all of Miyazaki's short movies are shown at the same time (only one is shown at a given period and they're rotated regularly). I guess I'll have to settle for the bad-quality bootlegs that you can find online...</comments>

        <comments>A rather small museum with a selection of ukiyo-e prints/paintings from a 12'000-piece collection. Some of them are serious. Some of them are funny. The styles, subjects, etc. are quite different. So a nice and quick visit.</comments>

        <comments>I'm not a fan of history (and ashamed of admitting it) and even less interested in military/war museums. Objectively, it looks like an interesting museum, with <em>a lot</em> of texts to read - some of them quite controversial (i.e. revisionist), apparently - and some impressive military artefacts (planes, etc.).</comments>

        <comments>I absolutely love this kind of museums: lots of rooms, lots of paintings. I could stay entire days there. Hieronymus Bosch is one of my favorite painters. His style is so unique. Not many original paintings of his, but several copies. I unfortunately missed the exhibition at the Het Noordbrabants Museum in 2016, which would have been a lot better, obviously.</comments>

        <comments>I don't know why, but I didn't appreciate this museum as much as I should have. I already visited it in 2009. The architectural reconstructions are impressive, but I was less impressed by the rest of the museum (and the temporary exhibition in particular - lots of texts to read, I was probably too tired...).</comments>

        <comments>I didn't know anything about the golem concept, so that temporary exhibition was instructive. The <i>A Muslim, a Christian and a Jew</i> exhibition was fun and easy to appreciate. We didn't spend a lot of time in the permanent exhibition part, as we already visited that museum in 2009. An important museum. Architecturally unique.</comments>
