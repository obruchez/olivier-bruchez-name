        <comments>It looks like a huge library with about 300'000 manga books, magazines, and other items. As a complete neophyte when it comes to mangas, I found it a little disconcerting (this time in a bad way). The central room had a lot of explanations that were interesting and fun to read, though.</comments>

        <comments>The permanent exhibition was a bit disappointing (too small), but the <i>Postwar German Posters for Films</i> exhibition was interesting (although it could have been better structured).</comments>

        <rating>4.5</rating>
        <comments>Not really a museum, but a gallery, with 15-20 small rooms / temporary exhibitions. Most of them by students or artists trying to get known. I was not particularly impressed by the paintings, drawings, etc. in themselves, but going in a small room, where the artist is present, looking at her/his art in front of her/him, and repeating the experience many times is a disconcerting experience (in a good way, if that makes sense).</comments>

        <comments>Not a bad museum, but definitely not my cup of tea (a heterogeneous collection of paintings, ceramics, textiles, etc.). The garden is absolutely beautiful, though.</comments>

        <museum>Ghibli Museum, Tokyo, Japan</museum>
        <rating>5.0</rating>
        <comments>This is a museum for children and for adults. Many, many, many small things to see (drawings, in particular, books, photos, etc.). Isao Takahata's personal photos from his trip to Switzerland in the 70s were quite funny. The museum is not too big and probably always almost full, so some rooms were very crowded and definitely less pleasant to visit. I was a bit disappointed to learn that not all of Miyazaki's short movies are shown at the same time (only one is shown at a given period and they're rotated regularly). I guess I'll have to settle for the bad-quality bootlegs that you can find online...</comments>

        <comments>A rather small museum with a selection of ukiyo-e prints/paintings from a 12'000-piece collection. Some of them are serious. Some of them are funny. The styles, subjects, etc. are quite different. So a nice and quick visit.</comments>

        <comments>Smaller than expected, but, overall, I really liked this museum. Lots of paintings, sculptures, video installations, etc. We had fun watching <i>Hideo, It’s Me, Mama</i> by Mako Idemitsu, but didn't have enought time to watch it until the end, unfortunately.</comments>

        <comments>I'm not a fan of history (and ashamed of admitting it) and even less interested in military/war museums. Objectively, it looks like an interesting museum, with <em>a lot</em> of texts to read - some of them quite controversial (i.e. revisionist), apparently - and some impressive military artefacts (planes, etc.).</comments>

        <comments>The permanent exhibition is well done, but probably more interesting for children. The special exhibition ("The Art of Disney - The Magic of Animation") was particularly well done - although not very "Japanese".</comments>

        <comments>We visited this museum to see if it would be suitable for a school trip. It's very well done, but, at the end of the day, it's a museum dedicated to one of the largest food companies in the world.</comments>

        <rating>5.25</rating>
        <comments>I absolutely love this kind of museums: lots of rooms, lots of paintings. I could stay entire days there. Hieronymus Bosch is one of my favorite painters. His style is so unique. Not many original paintings of his, but several copies. I unfortunately missed the exhibition at the Het Noordbrabants Museum in 2016, which would have been a lot better, obviously.</comments>

        <comments>I don't know why, but I didn't appreciate this museum as much as I should have. I already visited it in 2009. The architectural reconstructions are impressive, but I was less impressed by the rest of the museum (and the temporary exhibition in particular - lots of texts to read, I was probably too tired...).</comments>

        <rating>5.0</rating>
        <comments>I didn't know anything about the golem concept, so that temporary exhibition was instructive. The "A Muslim, a Christian and a Jew" exhibition was fun and easy to appreciate. We didn't spend a lot of time in the permanent exhibition part, as we already visited that museum in 2009. An important museum. Architecturally unique.</comments>

        <comments>The temporary exhibition about science-fiction movies was really well done. The rest of the museum is also really worth a visit. The starting room, with the mirrors, is a lot of fun.</comments>

        <comments>Contemporary art is sometimes baffling. A good thing I liked to be baffled. I was not always impressed by the temporary exhibitions, but they were not bad either. I like the main hall of the museum. It's huge. And almost empty.</comments>
