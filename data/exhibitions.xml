        <comments>I honeslty didn't expect to enjoy this museum as much as I did. We mainly went there because (thanks?) to our 2-year old son. This was a brief magical return to childhood.</comments>

        <comments>Very nice exhibition around Les Cités obscures by François Schuiten and Benoît Peeter. It was the first time I visited the Maison d'Ailleurs, an impressive little museum (the library is gorgeous). Now I really need to (re)read all the Cités obscures series!</comments>

        <comments>This is a park including the Vigeland installation, which consists of hundreds (?) of sculptures, in a kind of outdoor museum. The sculptures are sometimes funny, sometimes shocking, and almost always weird. I really liked it.</comments>

        <comments>A way better exhibition than the one in Sion. The museum itself is bigger. We're still talking about lithographs, but there were more of them and they were more interesting. One original lithography stone was also exposed and the same video about the Idem presses in Paris was shown.</comments>

        <comments>It's hard to rate such a small exhibition. It's basically ten lithographs (edition 12 our of 30), one original lithography stone, a small video by David Lynch about the lithography process in Paris, a couple of pictures of David Lynch working on lithography stones (or metal plates?), and the <i>David Lynch: The Art Life</i> documentary, which I had already seen in 2017. I was probably the only visitor that day.</comments>

        <rating>4.0</rating>
        <comments>Exhibition located a the top of the Mauvoisin Dam. "Charrière's new work traces the historical and geographical path between Mount Tambora in Indonesia, which erupted in 1815, and the Alps. It follows the entangled threads of climate devastation, monocultural farming, and an imaginary in which apocalyptic ecological threats find poetic utterance in the aesthetic of the sublime." Yes: the sublime; Charrière's photos are simply beautiful. There's a link between the <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1815_eruption_of_Mount_Tambora">1815 eruption of Mount Tambora</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gi%C3%A9tro_Glacier">1818 Giétro Glacier catastrophe</a>, which makes those photos even more poignant.</comments>

        <comments>I forgot to comment on this museum, so I'm reviewing it six months later. I enjoyed it less than expected. It's definitely not a bad museum, far from it, but after visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art a few days before, I guess it was a bit of a letdown.</comments>

        <rating>4.5</rating>
        <comments>We spent a bit more than an hour and a half in this museum. It was more impressive than the Richard H. Driehaus Museum in Chicago, but somewhat similar (rich person's house with expensive art, furniture, and decorative objects). The collection itself (paintings) was moderately interesting, but the audio guide was very well done and I enjoyed the visit. Some of the paintings were from famous artists (Degas, Manet, Monet), but most of them were from artists that were unknown to me.</comments>

        <rating>5.5</rating>
        <comments>We started with the highlights tour. The guide was really nice and her explanations were really easy to understand (i.e. not too technical). One hour and seven pieces of art later, we started a proper tour of a rather small subset of the museum. We went to the Roof Garden (<i>The Theater of Disappearance</i> special exhibit), the Greek and Roman Art section (statues, etc.), the Modern and Contemporary Art section, the 19<sup>th</sup>- and Early 20<sup>th</sup>-Century European Paintings and Sculpture section, and, finally, the European Paintings, 1250-1800 section (a lot more quickly, just before the museum closed). More than six hours in this fantastic museum was still not enough to see everything. Definitely one of the best museums I've ever visited.</comments>

        <comments>I really liked this museum, even though, as I already wrote for the Yūshūkan War Memorial Museum entry, I'm not a fan of history. It contains a good mix of texts, documents, and videos. It presents an American point of view, of course, but it's probably way less controversial than the Yūshūkan War Memorial Museum. Some of the topics were more sensitive (racism, treatment of the minority groups, and, in particular, of the Japanese Americans, etc.), but presented in a transparent way. The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were, I think, presented in a sufficiently detailed way (it's difficult to say what a "neutral" point of view would look like...). I realized I really don't know much about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_War">Pacific War</a> (I didn't even know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Darwin">Australia was bombed during the war</a>...). We spent three hours in the museum, but it was not enough. Unfortunately, we had to go a bit faster through the "Road to Tokyo" and "Road to Berlin" exhibits.</comments>

        <comments>My rating is a bit harsh, but I was expecting more. This is basically a house that belonged to a rich banker, acquired by Driehaus, that now hosts the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driehaus_Museum#Collection">Driehaus Collection</a>. A lot of furniture and posters. The first floor was the most impressive. It's expensive for what it is.</comments>

        <comments>One of the highlights of our trip to Chicago. This is my type of museum. Huge. Beautiful paintings everywhere. I especially liked the 19<sup>th</sup>- and 20<sup>th</sup>-century sections. Of course, we haven't had the time to visit the whole museum. The restaurant (Terzo Piano) was also excellent and a welcome pause during our 6-hour visit.</comments>

        <comments>A very nice museum, for children and adults. The omnipresence of wax figures gives the place a special touch. They're sometimes almost disturbing, especially when you don't realize right away that they're not visitors. There is a nice balance between the texts to read, the movies to watch, and the movie sets to visit. The Champ de Ban Estate Manor is also interesting. The bathroom with Einstein in front of the mirror is a funny experience. It's a symbol of the whole museum/manor, in a way.</comments>

        <comments>It looks like a huge library with about 300'000 manga books, magazines, and other items. As a complete neophyte when it comes to mangas, I found it a little disconcerting (this time in a bad way). The central room had a lot of explanations that were interesting and fun to read, though.</comments>

        <comments>Not really a museum, but a gallery, with 15-20 small rooms / temporary exhibitions, most of them by students or artists trying to get known. I was not particularly impressed by the paintings, drawings, etc. in themselves, but going into a small room, where the artist is present, looking at her/his art in front of her/him, and repeating the experience many times is a disconcerting experience (in a good way, if that makes sense).</comments>

        <comments>This is a museum for children and adults. Many, many small things to see (drawings, in particular, books, photos, etc.). Isao Takahata's personal photos from his trip to Switzerland in the 70s were quite funny. The museum is not too big and probably always almost full, so some rooms were very crowded and definitely less pleasant to visit. I was a bit disappointed to learn that not all of Miyazaki's short movies are shown at the same time (only one is shown at a given period and they're rotated regularly). I guess I'll have to settle for the bad-quality bootlegs that you can find online...</comments>

        <comments>A rather small museum with a selection of ukiyo-e prints/paintings from a 12'000-piece collection. Some of them are serious. Some of them are funny. The styles, subjects, etc. are quite different. So a nice and quick visit.</comments>

        <comments>Smaller than expected, but, overall, I really liked this museum. Lots of paintings, sculptures, video installations, etc. We had fun watching <i>Hideo, It’s Me, Mama</i> by Mako Idemitsu, but didn't have enough time to watch it until the end, unfortunately.</comments>

        <comments>I'm not a fan of history (and ashamed of admitting it) and even less interested in military/war museums. Objectively, it looks like an interesting museum, with <em>a lot</em> of texts to read - some of them quite controversial (i.e. revisionist), apparently - and some impressive military artefacts (planes, etc.).</comments>

        <comments>The permanent exhibition is well done, but probably more interesting for children. The special exhibition (<i>The Art of Disney - The Magic of Animation</i>) was particularly well done - although not very "Japanese".</comments>

        <comments>I absolutely love this kind of museums: lots of rooms, lots of paintings. I could stay entire days there. Hieronymus Bosch is one of my favorite painters. His style is so unique. Not many original paintings of his, but several copies. I unfortunately missed the exhibition at the Het Noordbrabants Museum in 2016, which would have been a lot better, obviously.</comments>

        <comments>I don't know why, but I didn't appreciate this museum as much as I should have. I already visited it in 2009. The architectural reconstructions are impressive, but I was less impressed by the rest of the museum (and the temporary exhibition in particular - lots of texts to read, I was probably too tired...).</comments>

        <comments>I didn't know anything about the golem concept, so that temporary exhibition was instructive. The <i>A Muslim, a Christian and a Jew</i> exhibition was fun and easy to appreciate. We didn't spend a lot of time in the permanent exhibition part, as we already visited that museum in 2009. An important museum. Architecturally unique.</comments>
