        <museum>Fondation Pierre Gianadda, Martigny, Switzerland</museum>
        <rating>4.25</rating>
        <comments>The exhibition itself is well done, but ultimately I'm probably less receptive to prints (lithographs, etchings, etc.) than to painting in general. That said, there were a few works I really liked, especially among the darker subjects toward the end of the exhibition.</comments>

        <rating>4.75</rating>
        <comments>"The Fondation de l'Hermitage is highlighting the remarkably vibrant art of Poland in the period 1850–1914. [...] This exhibition featuring 100 iconic works is exploring the main movements reflected in the work of Polish artists: Romanticism, Realism, Impressionism, Symbolism and Modernism." I didn't know any of the painters, I think, but it was still a nice exhibition, as usual.</comments>

        <comments>There were some Manet and Renoir paintings, but also paintings by Gustave Caillebotte, which had an exhibition dedicated to him in 2021 at Fondation Pierre Gianadda. A large section was dedicated to Théophile-Alexandre Steinlen, with his impressive <i>Apothéose des chats</i>.</comments>

        <rating>4.5</rating>
        <comments>It was the last day of the exhibition. I think I had never seen so many people in a museum before. As a result, the visit wasn't pleasant. The selected works were rare, apparently. For my part, I realized I wasn't particularly moved by Matisse's work.</comments>

        <comments>Our first visit in 12 years, this time with our 6-year-old son. It's a place that's well-suited for both children, given the playful aspect of the machines, and parents, who can reflect on the nature of art, for example.</comments>

        <comments>It's important to understand and remember that sending a letter accross the world, less than a century ago, was something completely crazy and difficult. At least sometimes. Courageous people risked their lives. Now, of course, you just send an email or a WhatsApp message, but there's less adventure in the process.</comments>

        <comments>We've only seen a small part of the Cité de l'Espace, as it's quite big. The presentation of the Mars rovers was particularly well done. Also the part about the new Moon missions, explaining how human beings will be able to live on the Moon, etc., was interesting for adults, as well as for our 4-year-old son. We live exciting times and the exhibit managed to convey that.</comments>

        <comments>We only had the time to visit the permanent exhibition, including a section dedicated to Böcklin, which I really liked. The last time we visited the museum, in 2010, the Neubau building didn't exist (it was inaugurated in 2016). I also really liked the "20<sup>th</sup> century / classic modernism" part of the Hauptbau.</comments>

        <comments>I really like some of the artists presented (Braque, Cézanne, Ernst, Giacometti, van Gogh, Miró, etc.), but too many of the paintings fell into the "single-color-or-single-line" category for my taste. We'll probably come back to the Fondation Beyeler, but we'll choose the exhibition a bit more carefully.</comments>

        <comments>This might seem like a cliché, but I love Van Gogh. I've seen his paintings in Amsterdam and in various museums around the world. Seing them in a "multimedia experience" (whatever that means in 2021) is not the same as seing paintings on the walls of a museum, but it's nevertheless a good way to discover them. Everything was not perfect (the sound, in particular, could have been better), but this form of experimental museology is probably the way to go. In my opinion, art is best experienced in a dedicated physical space, but there are various ways to do it. Technology can help and I hope to see other similar experiences in the future.</comments>

        <comments>I wasn't familiar with Hans Emmenegger at all. I really liked his paintings of forest interiors. And it can seem weird, but his paintings of snow melting were also intriguing. I guess when you're a good painter, you can paint anything and still trigger strong emotions in the viewer.</comments>

It's basically ten lithographs (edition 12 out of 30), one original lithography stone, a small video by David Lynch about the lithography process in Paris, a couple of pictures of David Lynch working on lithography stones (or metal plates?), and the <i>David Lynch: The Art Life</i> documentary, which I had already seen in 2017. I was probably the only visitor that day.</comments>

        <comments>Exhibition located a the top of the Mauvoisin Dam. "Charrière's new work traces the historical and geographical path between Mount Tambora in Indonesia, which erupted in 1815, and the Alps. It follows the entangled threads of climate devastation, monocultural farming, and an imaginary in which apocalyptic ecological threats find poetic utterance in the aesthetic of the sublime." Yes: the sublime; Charrière's photos are simply beautiful. There's a link between the <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1815_eruption_of_Mount_Tambora">1815 eruption of Mount Tambora</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gi%C3%A9tro_Glacier">1818 Giétro Glacier catastrophe</a>, which makes those photos even more poignant.</comments>

        <comments>We spent a bit more than an hour and a half in this museum. It was more impressive than the Richard H. Driehaus Museum in Chicago, but somewhat similar (rich person's house with expensive art, furniture, and decorative objects). The collection itself (paintings) was moderately interesting, but the audio guide was very well done and I enjoyed the visit. Some of the paintings were from famous artists (Degas, Manet, Monet), but most of them were from artists that were unknown to me.</comments>

        <comments>We started with the highlights tour. The guide was really nice and her explanations were really easy to understand (i.e. not too technical). One hour and seven pieces of art later, we started a proper tour of a rather small subset of the museum. We went to the Roof Garden (<i>The Theater of Disappearance</i> special exhibit), the Greek and Roman Art section (statues, etc.), the Modern and Contemporary Art section, the 19<sup>th</sup>- and Early 20<sup>th</sup>-Century European Paintings and Sculpture section, and, finally, the European Paintings, 1250-1800 section (a lot more quickly, just before the museum closed). More than six hours in this fantastic museum was still not enough to see everything. Definitely one of the best museums I've ever visited.</comments>

        <comments>I really liked this museum, even though, as I already wrote for the Yūshūkan War Memorial Museum entry, I'm not a fan of history. It contains a good mix of texts, documents, and videos. It presents an American point of view, of course, but it's probably way less controversial than the Yūshūkan War Memorial Museum. Some of the topics were more sensitive (racism, treatment of the minority groups, and, in particular, of the Japanese Americans, etc.), but presented in a transparent way. The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were, I think, presented in a sufficiently detailed way (it's difficult to say what a "neutral" point of view would look like...). I realized I really don't know much about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_War">Pacific War</a> (I didn't even know <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Darwin">Australia was bombed during the war</a>...). We spent three hours in the museum, but it was not enough. Unfortunately, we had to go a bit faster through the "Road to Tokyo" and "Road to Berlin" exhibits.</comments>

        <comments>My rating is a bit harsh, but I was expecting more. This is basically a house that belonged to a rich banker, acquired by Driehaus, that now hosts the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driehaus_Museum#Collection">Driehaus Collection</a>. A lot of furniture and posters. The first floor was the most impressive. It's expensive for what it is.</comments>

        <comments>One of the highlights of our trip to Chicago. This is my type of museum. Huge. Beautiful paintings everywhere. I especially liked the 19<sup>th</sup>- and 20<sup>th</sup>-century sections. Of course, we haven't had the time to visit the whole museum. The restaurant (Terzo Piano) was also excellent and a welcome pause during our 6-hour visit.</comments>

        <comments>A very nice museum, for children and adults. The omnipresence of wax figures gives the place a special touch. They're sometimes almost disturbing, especially when you don't realize right away that they're not visitors. There is a nice balance between the texts to read, the movies to watch, and the movie sets to visit. The Champ de Ban Estate Manor is also interesting. The bathroom with Einstein in front of the mirror is a funny experience. It's a symbol of the whole museum/manor, in a way.</comments>

As a complete neophyte when it comes to mangas, I found it a little disconcerting (this time in a bad way).

        <comments>Not really a museum, but a gallery, with 15-20 small rooms / temporary exhibitions, most of them by students or artists trying to get known. I was not particularly impressed by the paintings, drawings, etc. in themselves, but going into a small room, where the artist is present, looking at her/his art in front of her/him, and repeating the experience many times is a disconcerting experience (in a good way, if that makes sense).</comments>

        <comments>This is a museum for children and adults. Many, many small things to see (drawings, in particular, books, photos, etc.). Isao Takahata's personal photos from his trip to Switzerland in the 70s were quite funny. The museum is not too big and probably always almost full, so some rooms were very crowded and definitely less pleasant to visit. I was a bit disappointed to learn that not all of Miyazaki's short movies are shown at the same time (only one is shown at a given period and they're rotated regularly). I guess I'll have to settle for the bad-quality bootlegs that you can find online...</comments>
