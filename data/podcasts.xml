    <comments>A lot of things are happening in the Prince world. I'm currently reading Prince's memoir, <i>The Beautiful Ones</i>. The super deluxe edition of <i>1999</i> will be released next weeek and is full of previously unreleased outtakes, including stuff that has never circulated on bootlegs. It's exciting.</comments>

    <comments>An episode about universe simulations (do we live in one?) and split-brains. Two fascinating topics. Do we all have two consciousnesses inside us? One silent and one that can talk? About simulations: I think the most important and interesting question is still "Can we actually simulate consciousness? Does it even make sense?" The <i>Black Mirror</i> episodes about this topic were really good, if I recall correctly.</comments>

    <comments>To sum it up: we don't know how often and how we should fast for optimal health. I, as a person with a low BMI, don't even know if it's a good idea to fast at all. Something that particularly intrigued me: the idea that deep sleep could be better/longer when fasting.</comments>

    <comments>One of my favorite topics (consciousness). I agree with Dave and Tamler that the more you talk about it, the less it becomes clear. It's weird. I actually think p-zombies, as I understand them, can be an illuminating thought experiment (how does consciousness "interact" with the world? does it cause anything? is it necessary?).</comments>

    <comments>Tom Bilyeu is impressively full of energy ("hyper", according to Peter Attia). I'd like to be more like him. An interesting discussion, but the more I think about it, the more I realize that successful people owe their success in large part to luck (e.g. meeting the right persons at the right moment, etc.) and good genes (i.e. how can you not achieve a lot when you're so full of energy?).</comments>

    <comments>I agree that "What's expected of us" by Ted Chiang doesn't tell much about free will. It's not even a good thought experiment. It involves time travel, so it's doomed right from the beginning... In that sense, "Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom" is far better, even if it's not coherent with what we understand of quantum mechanics. After the last three episodes, I still don't know how Tamler defines free will and why he thinks it exists.</comments>

    <comments>Harley only worked on the <i>20Ten</i> album and other tracks that were never released, as a sound engineer (he was there during the recording process, not the mixing process). He admits that he's not used to interviews, but he's fun to listen to. I like those interviews of "obscure" persons who worked for Prince, but that are not well known to fans.</comments>

    <comments>Taking photos makes us more attentive to details (e.g. we remember more about a painting we photographed), but it comes with a cost: we remember everything else less (e.g. we will remember less information from an audio guide if we photograph the paintings in a museum). Sharing an experience with another person amplifies it (i.e. it makes it more enjoyable if it's enjoyable and more unpleasant if it's unpleasant). Sharing a photo with other people on social media, on the other hand, is negative: "the benefits that you get from capturing photos are actually diminished or undermined when you take photos to share."</comments>

    <comments>We tend to have wrong intuitions about the effect of random/small social interactions with strangers. That effect is usually positive. Automation gives us more time, which should be positive, but at the same time, it removes some of those small social interactions, which is negative. It's the case for extroverts, as well as introverts. The conclusion is that we should all try and interact more with people around us, including complete strangers.</comments>

    <comments>On average, silver medalists are less happy than bronze medalists. This is because silver medalists tend to focus on the fact that they could have gotten a gold medal (i.e. they're unlucky), wheras bronze medalists tend to focus on the fact that they could have not gotten any medal (i.e. they're lucky). More generally, we tend to compare ourselves to the wrong persons/situations. We should practice negative visualisation more often (i.e. stoicism).</comments>

    <comments>We absolutely need carbon taxes. There are no reason not to have them, at least for products/services that have a clear impact on the environment. Ideally, we would also have taxes on products/services that have a negative impact on people/animals, but this would be way harder to implement. I also find interesting this idea that nuclear energy is not necessarily bad, at least with more advanced technologies. I think I agree. But the current climate is so anti-nuclear that it's a difficult idea to defend.</comments>

    <comments>A conversation about the relationship between space and cognition/language. The importance of imitation and gesture is especially striking when you have a young child. It's fascinating to think how a complex organ such as the brain can model our world. It's an impossible task and that's why there are so many <a href="https://medium.com/better-humans/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18">cognitive biases</a>. We usually see them as a negative thing, but they're just heuristics to simplify that task (i.e. understanding the world and navigating it).</comments>

    <episode url="https://verybadwizards.fireside.fm/173" number="173">Talking to Your (Alternate) Self [Ted Chiang's "Anxiety is the Dizziness of Freedom"]</episode>
    <comments>I haven't read the novel before listening to the episode, but I will read it ASAP (I had already bought a collection including that novel). It sounds like a very interesting novel to discuss the existence/absence of free will. I'm not sure the discussion between Tamler and Dave did the topic any justice. For example, Tamler seems to be confused about the relationship between quantum mechanics and determinism: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics#Comparison">some interpretations of quantum mechanics say that determinism is true; others say it is false or are agnostic about it.</a> Interestingly, the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics say determinism is true. I don't understand much about quantum mechanics, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't give us any freedom that could relate to the "free" in "free will". On the contrary, this episode made me even more convinced that the concept of free will doesn't make much sense. To go back to the story: if you can't find any parallel world where you acted differently for a given choice, it means that your choice really reflects who you are; but where's the freedom in that? If, for a given choice, you're on the edge, it's possible that your choice will eventually depends on completely contingent factors; where's the freedom in that?</comments>

    <comments>"[T]hey address the latest development in the literature around Benjamin Libet's famous study that, according to some people, proved that free will doesn't exist." To sum it up, we can show that for simple choices (pushing button A or B), when we don't have any conscious reasons to choose an option or another, it's possible that we take "neural noise" into account for our choices. It's a different interpretation of what Libet measured and it makes sense. I agree that it doesn't have much to say about free will. It doesn't add much to the debate. I still think Sam Harris has a point. I still think Daniel Dennett is missing something.</comments>

    <comments>Rick Doblin is an impressive person, willing to play the long game to make MDMA and psychedelics legal, by funding/encouraging serious scientific research. It's always striking to learn that there are so many bad scientific studies (e.g. early studies showing the benefits of psychedelics, such as the Concord Prison Experiment, but also studies showing the neurotoxicity of MDMA). It's important to realize that both the benefits and the risks of MDMA/psychedelics have been largely exaggerated.</comments>

    <comments><i>The Versace Experience</i> is just a weird release (made from a cassette tape, but released on CD, vinyl, and cassette...). Sony probably released this because they can't release <i>The Gold Experience</i> yet. I won't support this kind of releases with my money, though. Anyway, the episode itself is fun, as always, even though the reviews of each track are short (there's not much to say, almost everything being already released in non-edited form on other albums/singles).</comments>

    <comments>I liked the soccer/tennis analogy. Using an EEG to understand how soccer works is the wrong tool. In that case: just ask people (i.e. descriptive approach). The pessimistic conclusion is that the current academic context doesn't allow for those more descriptive or unorthodox approaches (used, for example, by people like Darwin, who were affluent enough to conduct their research as they saw fit).</comments>

    <comments>Niko Bolas sounds like a nice guy. He said himself that he's a pretty "unsophisticated" mixing engineer. I don't know if I would have used that exact word, but I kind of agree. For example, he was asked why he used so much reverb on Prince's vocals (something that was highly critized by fans) and, to paraphrase him, he did it because it sounded good to him. That's disappointing. Mixes shouldn't be done because they feel good. In that case (Prince's vault/archive), mixing engineers should use reference mixdowns and try to strictly recreate them. All those new mixes (2018 and later) should have been done by the original engineers (Peggy McCreary, David Leonard, Susan Rogers, etc.), but I guess they would be too expensive. Or don't work as mixing engineers anymore.</comments>

    <comments>I liked the part where Adam explained his skepticism about meditation, because he kind of has a good point. People give meditation too much credits. It's a tool. It's useful. It can also be beneficial if you use it right. But not necessarily. I still would like to know if Adam Grant really doesn't have a "monkey mind" or if he doesn't realize he has one. Are there people that really don't need meditation? It's an open question. I also liked the part about framing, i.e. how you can see a situation or even a feeling from different points of view. For example, anxiety and excitement share almost the same physiological characteristics. The difference is how we interpret those signs. We can't really control our physiological responses, but we can control our interpretations.</comments>

    <comments>An episode about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Truth_of_Fact,_the_Truth_of_Feeling">"The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling"</a>, a short story which is apparently very similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Entire_History_of_You">"Entire History of You"</a> episode of <i>Black Mirror</i>. Imperfect recall can help us integrating bad events in our lives. Imperfect recall also means that we forget the good moments in our lives. I've been journaling for more than a quarter century and I'm regularly reading my past entries (10 and 20 years ago). I encounter both cases: good moments that I had forgotten about and bad moments that I don't really enjoy reading about. Is this masochism? I don't think so. I don't think forgetting about an unpleasant past event is the best way to deal with it. Obviously, thinking everyday about something that happened ten years ago is not a good approach either, but if you're not able to think about a bad moment of your life while thinking that everything's okay, then it probably means that you've not completely processed that moment yet.</comments>

    <comments>Once you've realized that you don't either believe (completely) or don't believe (at all), but that all beliefs are nuanced/continuous/non-binary, one of the tricky parts is to set the "threshold" where you decide that you have enough evidence to act on a belief. Beliefs don't exist in a vacuum, so it's hard. You have to guess the consequences of your actions. A Bayesian approach seems to be reasonable.</comments>

    <episode url="https://verybadwizards.fireside.fm/158" number="158">False Dichotomies and Oral Reciprocity</episode>
    <comments>This is my view on the topic: separating things into two categories is something very basic/fundamental we do, because it's simple, but it probably also has a deeper, biological root. Neurons are excellent at discriminating patterns/inputs; they basically split the hyperspace of possible inputs into two parts. Dichotomies are just a particular/specific case of dimensionality reduction, like principal component analysis (PCA). Dichotomies are also motivated by action: at some point, you need to act, so you need to simplify your data. In real life, actions often come down to "I do something" vs "I don't do something". You can easily bring nuance to an X-vs-Y situation (e.g. introvert vs extrovert) by specifying "81% X and 19% Y", for example. Dichotomies don't have to be overly simplistic. Once the basics are understood, you can progressively complexify the discussion by adding back some of the dimensions that were removed. Ultimately, it seems obvious to me (and apparently also to Dave?) that only machines (using machine learning algorithms) will be able to accurately model complex sets of data (including human psychology).</comments>

The highlight of the episode is the moment when Toejam explains that "Strange But True" is his favorite song of all time (by Prince, but maybe also by any artist). This is an odd choice, but I can understand why. It's a fantastic song, even though it's a bit obscure.</comments>

    <comments><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Rich_Harris">Judith Rich Harris "was an American psychology researcher and the author of <i>The Nurture Assumption</i>, a book criticizing the belief that parents are the most important factor in child development, and presenting evidence which contradicts that belief."</a> I was not familiar with her. I guess this was a good introduction to the topic (i.e. the effect of parenting on child development) and the debate around it. As often, it's largely a question of distinguishing correlations from cause and effect relationships. Most studies about the topic are simplistic/lazy (but this is not an isolated problem). Studies about adopted children can make this distinction clearer. My conclusion is that parenting doesn't seem to be as important as we could think. The discussion about art and "problematic" artists was interesting, as usual.</comments>

    <comments>The models I had in mind (big crunch, infinite expansion, etc.) are all plausible, apparently. We don't know what will happen, because the universe is "only" 15-billion years old, so it's hard to extrapolate. A question I still have is: how plausible is a stable universe (i.e. a universe that doesn't lead to a big crunch or to heat death)? Philosophically, I find this idea (that the universe and everything it contains will cease to exist) very important, because it really changes how you see the future/goal of humanity as a whole.</comments>

    <comments>When I think of the Dunning-Kruger effect, I can immediately picture someone I know who suffers from this bias, but, let's be honest, we all have it, from time to time. The discussion about the "post-Dunning-Kruger effect", i.e. the realization that we (almost) don't know anything about anything (Socrates), was interesting. Bringing too many nuances to a discussion can be problematic. It can lead to inaction and look like a lack of enthusiasm, for example. Ironically, it's hard to know what to make of our lack of knowledge. At some point, you have to decide you know enough and act.</comments>

I'm still not convinced by the simulation argument. It's clever, but I'm not convinced. I had already heard of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter">Great Filter</a> (in the context of the Fermi paradox), but I think there are many other possible explanations. It basically comes down to predicting what an advanced civilization would do. And, just like for the technological singularity, there's simply no way to know, by definition.

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#Two_systems">two systems view of thinking</a> is a useful one. Here's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/b0dtbj/making_sense_podcast_150_the_map_of_understanding/eile7jp/">link to some of the points discussed</a>. The most fascinating part to me was the one about the experiencing self vs the remembering self and well-being. Money does increase your life satisfaction / "remembered happiness", but not your moment-to-moment happiness. Kahneman used to think moment-to-moment happiness was more important, but he changed his position. I'd like to hear more about this. It feels like something is missing. Are people with more money really happier (or more satisfied with their life) or do they <i>think</i> they're happier?</comments>

    <comments>I'm not a sports fan myself, but even I can see that the discussed paper is way too specific in what it measures (instant well-being after a match, etc.) to draw overall conclusions. It seems obvious to me that sports has a tribal/community aspect that's very important. Are all happiness papers too simplistic? I'm starting to think they might be.</comments>

    <comments>Like Dave and unlike Tamler, I'm quite sympathetic to the idea of antinatalism, without finding it completely satisfying. At least, people should think more before having children. Since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gideon_v._Wainwright">Gideon v. Wainwright</a>, people in the US have the right to be defended by an attorney provided by the state. This sounds like a good idea, but it hasn't worked as well as expected. There are many reasons why (cheap/bad attorneys, the fact that people are judged more harshly because they're defended, etc.). It's difficult to say that it wouldn't have been worse without the introduction of that right, though.</comments>

    <comments>I've never really had a problem with addiction (except maybe with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xylometazoline">xylometazoline</a>, video games, and coffee). I liked the parallel with Johann Hari's view in <i>Lost Connections</i> (i.e. that addiction has probably been overmedicalized). The discussion about selling organs a the end was a bit frustrating. There are so many potential problems with allowing people to sell their organs that it's difficult to take the idea seriously.</comments>

    <comments>The part about Louis CK's surprise set was interesting. First, I didn't know about it. Secondly, this poses the important question of the right form/amount of "punishment" when someone has done something morally wrong. I'm also wondering what Louis CK should do now. Should he continue stand-up comedy? Should he continue acting? Should he write for others? This will be interesting to witness (hopefully). I think I completely missed what George Sher's paper was about, which is not too suprising, as I disagree with the premise: "What happens once we realize that our moral convictions are often not better justified than the convictions of people who disagree with us?" When it comes to the is–ought problem, I'm way more sympathetic to Sam Harris' view than Tamler/Dave's view (which is the dominant position of philosophers in general).</comments>

    <comments>I liked the final discussion between Tamler and his daughter about season 3 of Twin Peaks. It was way more accessible than the previous episode about Twin Peaks. Also, Eliza's take sounds pretty cool. I like this idea of (almost Buddhist) cycles and unresolved issues. I also liked the part about death and immortality. Would I want to be immortal? Well, yes, why not? The popular consensus seems to be that it would be boring and that you would run out of things to do. It makes sense. But ask yourself: if you're happy (and that's a big "if"), at which point would you decide that you don't want to live anymore? Exactly: never. And I think that you can be happy doing the same things over and over again. Isn't that what we're all doing anyway? More or less? Now, if you're the only immortal person among mortal persons, that means that you will see everyone around you die, which could be a traumatic experience. But, as discussed in the episode, we already experience that with our pets. In the end, it all depends on the kind of immortality we're talking about. I'm not sure our human psychology has to be seen as something that couldn't be changed (artificially), for example.</comments>

    <comments>Dark energy. Like dark matter, it's everywhere. It's expanding the universe.

    <comments>Statistically, yes, someday, an asteroid will probably hit the Earth (again). 5 meters is the threshold for an asteroid to reach the ground. Anything less than that should completely burn in the atmosphere. For reference, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_impactor">the asteroid which killed the dinosaurs 66 millions years ago</a> had a diameter of 11-81 kilometers. We've been tracking potentially dangerous celestial bodies for decades now. We should be safe for the century to come. We don't have the necessary technology to change the trajectory of an asteroid yet (e.g. powerful enough rocket, powerful bomb, massive enough body to attract the asteroid, etc.).</comments>

We don't even know what space is and if space goes on forever or not. More specifically, we don't know for sure if the universe is flat or has an intrinsic curvature. It's pretty likely it's flat, though (based on measurements of the cosmic background radiation).</comments>

It's a crazy hypothesis, but we've discarded all other hypotheses. We need dark matter to explain how galaxies move/rotate. Gravitational lensing also proves dark matter exists and we've observed two galaxies colliding which each other as a more direct proof of its existence.</comments>

    <comments>A clear and very enjoyable discussion. A lot of it was about meditation, but it was way more accessible (i.e. less esoteric) than the discussions with Joseph Goldstein. It's good to remember that anger doesn't last unless we "feed" it and that it's always a good idea to try and see the world from other people's perspectives.

    <comments>This is probably the question that I found the most interesting: "What is your relationship to money? How important is it to your happiness?" I always had that sense that, yes, money is important up to a certain point, and then it doesn't change anything. Apparently, the main study people are citing differentiates between two measures of well-being: moment-to-moment well-being and life satisfaction. According to Sam (I haven't checked), money and life satisfaction are correlated even for larger amounts of money. I don't know what to make of this. Sam's explanation (money buys time) doesn't completely make sense to me.</comments>

The discussion went to interesting places (skepticism, stoicism, etc.). Another thing that's still not clear to me: to what extend hypnosis is a serious thing.

    <comments>I had always thought that the consensus was that there was nothing before the Big Bang, because spacetime started with the Big Bang, so the question doesn't really make sense (like "What is north of North Pole?"). Apparently, there is no such consensus. It's one of the possibilities, but we actually don't know. There might have been something before the Big Bang, just like there might be something outside of our universe. There's a strong likelihood what we will be stuck with speculations about those questions forever. The little we know about the Big Bang comes from "hints" that are still observable, such as the cosmic microwave background (CMB).</comments>

I've never tried this "trick" at an event with many people. Maybe a list of generic questions could be helpful as well, but the dynamics of such events are often less predictable (will one person monopolize the conversation, for example?).</comments>

    <comments>I started listening to this episode without realizing that Johann Hari is the author of <i>Lost Connections</i>, which <a href="http://olivier.bruchez.name/books#2018-09-11">I finished reading in September 2018</a>. Sam didn't talk much. A lot of what Hari said is detailed in his book. They also talked a lot about addiction being the symptom of lack of meaning, etc. I liked how Hari is looking for indirect causes. "It's a bit more complicated than that", as Ben Goldacre would say. He also talked a lot about how we should talk with each other when we disagree (about Trump, for example). Again, being pro-Trump is the symptom of real problems, that we should take seriouly and shouldn't ridicule or belittle. Overall, Hari is a really interesting guy. Certainly not a mental health expert, but he has talked to enough of them to know what he's talking about.</comments>

    <comments>Most of the Peach &amp; Black panel (with the exception of Captain) thinks that this is the weakest of the first three Time albums. I agree. I wouldn't call <a href="http://princevault.com/index.php?title=If_The_Kid_Can%27t_Make_You_Come">"If The Kid Can't Make You Come"</a> a filler, though. Yes, the lyrics are silly, it's a bit longish (especially the unreleased, unedited version, at 9:12), and wine apparently played a significant part during the studio session, but from a musical point of view, it's an intriguing piece of music.</comments>

    <episode>Live in Toronto with Brian Greene</episode>
    <comments>A lot of rehashed questions in the Q&amp;A question, but I enjoyed the main discussion a lot, especially the part about the different interpretations of quantum mechanics. I was happy to hear than Greene seems to be sympathetic to the De Broglie–Bohm theory. I like it, too, because you don't need to completely throw away your intuitions to accept it. Greene is a vegetarian, so I wish they talked more about this topic. Sam is always disappointing with his old, incoherent arguments (the "happy cow farm" thought experiment, never talking about environmental impacts, not realizing that he is setting a bad example, etc.). A summary of the event can be found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/9dkbh2/anyone_at_the_toronto_event_last_night/e5ifpcb/">here</a>.</comments>

    <episode>Live in Philadelphia with Janna Levin and Maria Popova</episode>
    <comments>This episode suffers from the same problems as "What Is and What Matters": the two guests are interesting, but it would have worked better with one guest at a time; the Q&amp;A section is too long, sometimes embarrassing, and it gets repetitive (some questions are repeated in one form or another from one event to another). That being said, I liked the part about the need for secular communities and rituals. I still don't know what the actual solutions are (meetups? conferences? secular churches?), but we need to think about it. One thing I'm now trying after hearing that episode: I've added a "one year ago today" section in my diary (Maria Popova's idea, if I recall correctly).</comments>

    <episode number="47">It's ethical for me to be unethical</episode>
    <comments>No, it's not. What a frustrating episode! It could have been called "Looking for excuses" or "Too lazy to do the right thing". :) First, <a href="https://bruchez.blogspot.com/2016/10/le-purisme-vegetarien.html">I've already responded to some of the points mentioned (again) in this episode</a> - mainly vegetarians being a "pain in the ass" when going out with friends; don't tell me you can't find a restaurant that pleases a group of 4-5 persons that includes one vegetarian! Erik is right: there are multiple moral theories and, thus, different ways to determine whether one action is "good" or "bad". Consequentialism, for example, is only interested in consequences of one's actions. Virtue ethics and deontology are other approaches in normative ethics. But I find Erik's consequentialist analyses way too simplistic. By not eating meat, you're not only <a href="http://www.countinganimals.com/how-many-animals-does-a-vegetarian-save/">saving the lives of several thousands animals over the course of your life</a> (and diminishing the amount of suffering in the world, although it's very hard to quantify that), you're also setting an example, probably (I hope!) triggering private conversions (or at least more subtle changes), forcing restaurants to adapt, etc. By following similar arguments to Erik's, you can come to the conclusion that it's useless, or even ethical, not to vote (a common argument, as noted by Alex) or useless and/or ethical not to boycott a company that does questionable things. Also, as noted by Alex, by not eating meat, you're not doing something useful instead of another thing that's also useful (like in the case of fixing one bug instead of another bug). It's not a "resource allocation" problem. You're doing it in addition to the other things you're doing. And if your friends think you're a pain in the ass for "doing the right thing", then maybe you should consider seeing more supportive friends. Or is that simply called "friends"? :)</comments>

    <comments>A fun review of Prince's latest (posthumous) album, released in September 2018. The album is a 34-minute piano rehearsal, which had previously been circulating on bootlegs for almost 30 years. They didn't find the original tapes, only a cheap cassette tape in Prince's vault, so this is a particularly hissy recording (but still better than the bootlegs). They could have released way more interesting recordings from the vault, but, at the same time, this is a good sign: the Prince estate is apparently open to releasing unusual/archival albums. At the same time, Prince was releasing a lot of odd stuff at the end of his life (bits and pieces of rehearsals, etc.), so, in a sense, even if Prince would have never released that album himself, it's somewhat in line with what he was doing from time to time.</comments>

    <episode number="46">Makers</episode>
    <comments>"Make something with my hands" (sculpture? painting? etc.) has been on my "brainstorming list" for a long time. I wouldn't say that making physical things is in the same category as writing or coding. In both cases, it can be an expression of creativity, but I would bet that evolution "wants" us to be creative with our hands, not only with our brains. Our grandfather was definitely a maker. I remember building a miniature wood bench and table with him (I probably don't have them anymore, unfortunately). Similarly, I also remember knitting a small scarf for our cat. We also built a few things at school, but I can't remember any physical things I built or made after my teenage years (if you except pieces of furniture). I guess one of the reasons I don't have a hobby that necessitates a lot of space (e.g. painting, etc.) is the simple fact that we live in an apartment. It also goes against my minimalist side. About insignificance: it's very difficult to make an impact with anything (blogs, podcasts, music, software, etc.). It has never been so easy to create and distribute digital content, but it gets diluted in an ocean of similar content. My current conclusion about this problem: use your money to have an actual impact (<a href="https://www.givewell.org/">GiveWell</a>, etc.); build/make things because you enjoy it, even if it's not particularly useful to other people.</comments>

    <comments>Harari doesn't necessarily like the idea of universal basic income (UBI). It depends on what you mean by "universal" (national is not enough, you have to have an international system) and "basic" (people have to be able to do what they like, not only what's needed to survive). An interesting idea: nationalism is a good sign; we have naturally evolved to live in tribes of about 100 persons which we personally know; if we can go from tribes to whole countries, it's encouraging, because it means that we'll be able to go from countries to the whole humankind (i.e. we can probably go against our evolutionary instincts all the way). A piece of advice from Harari: if you want to have an impact, join an organization, don't act alone. This episode confirmed that I really like Harari.</comments>

    <episode url="https://www.danielandjorge.com/podcasts/are-we-living-in-a-simulation.htm">Are we Living in a Simulation?</episode>
    <comments>My personal answer is no, but it's a very important question. I don't find it odd or silly. It's generally not a testable question, but if we make the hypothesis that the simulation is imperfect, then it can become testable. Basically, we can use what we know about current physics simulations and/or video games to make some very concrete assumptions about the simulation we're living in (hypothetically). Even if we're not living in a simulation, it's interesting to see our universe as a kind of computer. It computes what we measure in a particle accelerator, for example. And it computes it way faster than our current computers (which would need billions of years or way more to give the same results). This is why we do experiments. Because we can't do effective simulations yet (either because our computers suck, or because our algorithms suck, or because we don't have correct models yet). The problem of philosophical zombies was briefly mentioned as well. Can we simulate consciousness? Does that question make sense? Can we produce artificial consciousness? This is probably a better question. Can we do it with silicon-based computers? If I remember correctly, Giulio Tononi doesn't seem to think so.</comments>

    <comments>The question of how we should raise our children is interesting. We naturally tend to overprotect them, but this leads to some problems, as seen on some American campuses these last few years (oversensitivity, self-victimization, etc.). The idea is, for example, to let them play with other children in a completely unsupervised environment from time to time.</comments>

    <episode number="45">Fifty percent fun</episode>
    <comments>I agree that most things you do individually don't have a lot of impact (e.g. not driving a car, not eating meat, etc.), but I can't help but think that counting on technology to really solve the problem globally (e.g. electric cars, artificial meat, etc.) is also quite lazy. I think it was in <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaidoyer_pour_les_animaux"><i>Plaidoyer pour les animaux</i></a> (<i>A Plea for the Animals</i>, in English) that Matthieu Ricard was contemplating what we can do to trigger "ethical revolutions" (I don't remember what wording he was using). What I retain from this is that individual actions count, at least by setting examples, triggering discussions, etc. But looking at the most effective ways to change things is always a good idea. About the fun-vs-hard-work ratio: I like the "loss of cabin pressure" metaphor (I don't remember where I heard it first); attend to your own mask before you try to help anybody else with theirs (including children). So, yes, you have to be as helpful as possible to other persons, but you have to think of yourself first or you won't be very helpful to others (in case of loss of pressure, you could faint or die, obviously).</comments>

    <episode url="https://verybadwizards.fireside.fm/147" number="147">Effective Altruism and Moral Uncertainty (with The One True Scotsman, Will MacAskill)</episode>
    <comments>I've heard MacAskill on Sam Harris' and Tim Ferriss' podcasts in 2016. I've been very intrigued by the idea of effective altruism since then. This episode is more technical. How do you "compute" what you should do (i.e. take decisions) under uncertainty? I can't say I've understood everything I've heard, but I guess one of the interesting points is that you can hold several views / use several frameworks (even incompatible ones) at the same time (e.g. extreme / radical utilitarianism that say that you should care the same about your son as you should about a complete stranger, at the same time as more intuitive views that say that you should care more about your son than about a complete stranger) and still come to a conclusion. That's what MacAskill's current research is about. An important point: effective altruism is not the same as utilitarianism. Finally, doing "moral calculations" is not an intuitive thing for most people, so a certain percentage of the time, it's perfectly okay to be a bit more spontaneous and, for example, to give a small amount of money to a random person asking for donations. Doing so is less off-putting to most people than being strict and trying to give money only to the most effective causes you can find. Often, the (symbolic) signals you're sending are important as well.</comments>

    <comments>15-20 years ago, I was way more into pirating music and consuming "free" stuff than these last few years. I'm now more and more into paying for FLAC files, supporting creators via Patreon, donating to websites/services that I find useful, etc. The idea that we should pay for good content has become quite natural to me. I don't know what convinced me exactly. One thing is sure: I hate ads and I'd gladly pay for services I use everyday, just as Google Search, Gmail, Google Docs, Google Calendar, etc. (especially if it means that I can actually get support). I'd gladly pay for good articles via an application such as Instapaper. About music/books: we live in a period of abundance; it's easy to record music and distribute it, write books and distribute them, but I guess it has never been so hard to get noticed and live from those activities. We need to find new paradigms.</comments>

    <episode number="44">The fun out of life</episode>
    <comments>Effective altruism (Peter Singer, William MacAskill, etc.) is a very useful tool one can use to look at this kind of problems (e.g. is it worth paying more for a car or not?). Another tool that was not mentioned in the episode is psychology and, in particular, what it has to say about happiness. According to Daniel Gilbert (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stumbling_on_Happiness"><i>Stumbling on Happiness</i></a>), we are very bad at predicting what makes us happy or not. In general, accumulating more stuff (or more expensive stuff) doesn't lead to more happiness. It at least works for me: I know that the more physical stuff I have around me, the more anxious I get. One simple rule I try to apply as much as possible is the 30-day rule: whenever I want something, I wait for 30 days or more; then if I still want that thing, I can seriously consider buying it. A lot of people love buying stuff, though. It can be easily understood from an evolutionary perspective: for a very long time, we evolved in a scarce environment, so it made perfect sense to accumulate as much stuff (and food in particular) as possible. It doesn't really make sense anymore in our modern environment.</comments>

Des affichages "smileys" mesurant le niveau sonore plutôt que la vitesse vont bientôt être testés en Suisse alémanique. La séquence concernant le CBD (le "cannabis légal") était intéressante. En gros, il y a du potentiel (anxiété, dépression, etc.), mais il faudra attendre le résultat des centaines d'études en cours pour y voir plus clair.

    <comments>What's the ideal computer setup? I tend to go the "minimalist" way at home, i.e. just a laptop, no desktop computer, no external monitor, keyboard, mouse, or trackpad. I use a laptop at work as well, with an external monitor, keyboard, and trackpad, this time. Scala compilation is a problem, but I can live with it. I've never been tempted by a tablet / iPad so far. In practice, my personal MacBook Pro is not significantly bulkier than an iPad Pro, as if you want to do anything serious on an iPad, you'll need a physical keyboard anyway. Another thing is that you always get used to more powerful computers, so it's an never-ending game. For vacations/trips, my iPhone (Plus) is usually good enough. I sometimes use a Bluetooth keyboard to type longer texts.</comments>

    <comments>I read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel"><i>The Library of Babel</i></a> for the first time in my life a few days ago. As a computer scientist, I immediately thought that I could easily write a very short and simple program to enumerate all possible books of 410 pages and 3200 characters per page. Of course, this program would have to run for longer than the universe will exist. Most "books" wouldn't make any sense. Interesting information would be lost in quasi-infinite noise, so such a program (and, hence, the Library of Babel) would be completely useless. All in all, I fail to see the brilliance of that story. Yes, it's intriguing, but I'd say it's the discussions that it triggers that are interesting, not really the story itself. It kind of reminded me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Tour_(comics)"><i>La Tour</i></a>, from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Cit%C3%A9s_obscures"><i>Cités obscures</i></a> series.</comments>

    <comments>Universal Basic Income, or a similar solution, is inevitable. Jobs will disappear and, contrarily to what many people believe, we won't be able to retrain everybody to do something else. It's simply impossible. The hard question is: how do we transition from where we are today to a world with even more automation and even less jobs? Many people still believe that new jobs will magically appear, but there's no physical law that guarantees this. In a sense, we have created many new jobs, but a lot of them are what some call <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/under-review/the-bullshit-job-boom">"bullshit jobs"</a>. I don't see the value in such jobs. Another hard question is: how much money should we give to people? Enough to survive? Enough to live comfortably? How can we implement UBI in a country when other countries don't implement it? And, finally, how can we make sure that people still have meaning in their life without jobs? Those questions are so hard, I fear no country will ever implement UBI before it's too late...</comments>

    <comments>According to my own anecdotal experience, doctors usually don't know what they're talking about, but it's not because they're not intelligent or knowledgeable, it's because the whole field of healthcare/medicine is very complex and there are a lot of information available (research papers, etc.), a lot of it of poor quality. It's especially true when it comes to nutrition. The first two thirds of this episode were pretty disappointing (generic, vague answers, etc.). The last third (about Shapiro's book) was more interesting (i.e. with more "actionable" information), but, still, it was pretty basic overall.</comments>

    <comments>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit-association_test">Wikipedia</a>: "The implicit-association test (IAT) is a measure within social psychology designed to detect the strength of a person's automatic association between mental representations of objects (concepts) in memory." I had previously read that a lot of people who explicitly don't consider themselves racist can be shown by an IAT test to be implictly "racist". This episode gave me some perspective on the limitations of that kind of tests. What does it mean exactly to be racist? Should we only care about what people do (behaviour) and not about what people think?</comments>

    <comments>I'm beginning to understand why Tamler and David are so critical of moral dilemmas (trolley, etc.) and related studies. I agree with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VeryBadWizards/comments/8lcwpd/episode_140_milgrims_mice/dzes4ne/">a comment on Reddit</a>: "the study doesn't really say much of anything interesting about what it sets out to, but on the other hand measuring or testing these things is damn hard in real life". Also, using mice as a proxy for human beings is probably not a good idea. It often doesn't work in biology/medicine and, here, it's obvious that's it's a poor choice for a psychology study.</comments>

This one is about the recent events (i.e. the release of "Nothing Compares 2 U", the photos of the vault at Paisley Park, the celebration, etc.). I don't know if I'm right, but, at the moment, I'm confident that Prince's audiovisual archive is in professionnal/serious hands. This is very comforting.

These are just a couple of questions raised by the excellent <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i>, which I watched again for the first time since its release, just before listening to this episode. I guess I don't have much to say about this episode. I enjoyed it. It made me watch the movie again. And then it gave me a new perspective on it. I'm with Tamler on the ending: I have an optimistic interpretation of it.</comments>

    <comments>Ehrman seems to know what he's talking about. This was a refreshing episode. I don't know much about the Bible. A lot of what was discussed was interesting and/or new to me (the inconsistencies between the different books, the reason why the resurrection was introduced as a concept, etc.). I was also kind of surprised to hear both Ehrman and Sam discuss the historicity of Jesus as if it was obvious that Jesus did in fact exist (i.e. as if no alternative explanation was worth discussing). Ehrman is "almost certain" Jesus existed. I thought "serious", non-believing Bible scholars thought it was probable, but not "almost certain".</comments>

    <comments>I read <i>Anything You Want</i> in 2011. I kind of liked it, although it's not the greatest book I've ever read. Some interesting ideas were discussed in this episode. Perfectionism is a bad idea and "good enough" is a good target. We should listen to the psychological pain we feel and treat it as a sign that we're doing something wrong (i.e. something that we shouldn't do). Derek mainly did things that were helpful to other people (when developing CD Baby). He didn't want to become big. <a href="https://sivers.org/books">Derek takes notes while reading books and wants to learn as much as possible from them</a>. He tried to summarize all the books he read into a kind of <a href="https://sivers.org/d1">to-do list</a>. Derek is influenced by stoicism and minimalism. I like it. What I don't really like is his <a href="https://sivers.org/d1u">"get rich"</a> directive, but I guess it can be understood as effective altruism (i.e. earn money to give it to others).</comments>

    <comments>Sam and Sean disagree on free will and morality. To sum it up, I think I understand why Sean defends his positions (compatibilism, Hume's is-ought, etc.), but I'm definitely not convinced they're very useful positions. I felt the discussion was neither about semantics nor about what really matters (ethical/judicial conclusions). I mean: yes, as agents, we make choices, even in a deterministic universe, but are those choices free and what do we mean by free? That's the question. Stop talking about free will, because people use those words to talk about different things. It's confusing. So, yes, I'm with Sam and not with Sean on that one. And I didn't really learn anything new on why compatibilists and determinists disagree. It's frustrating.</comments>

    <comments>I was already very intrigued by this idea the last time I heard about it (in episode 133). "You might think that Buddhist conceptions of the self as illusory would reduce their fear of death (after all, if there's no real self, why worry about it ceasing to exist?). But the evidence collected by Shaun and colleagues suggests exactly the opposite. Why would that be?" Are Buddhists more aware of their feeling of fear? Are they more honest about it? Or is this result simply caused by the fact that you actually have to be a long-time meditator to really integrate the fact (?) that the self is an illusion? Or is it caused by the fact that Buddhists are usually happier, live their life more fully, and, hence, are more afraid of death?</comments>

    <comments>I don't know how to sum up this discussion, but the question is interesting: "What happens when we discover why we believe the things we believe? What if we discover that our values are the product of our cultural tradition, or personal experience, or natural selection? Should we be more skeptical of our values once we learn their history?" Sometimes, it doesn't change anything (e.g. knowing why we prefer some things over other things doesn't really change the fact that we like what we like) and, sometimes, it can change everything (e.g. knowing why we're biased or why we developed some moral instincts).</comments>

    <comments>Most personal development / self-help books are useless, but I remain convinced that some advice <em>has</em> to be useful, especially if it comes from good, science-based psychology research. So I like this idea of applying psychology ideas to our own lives. Some "tips" mentioned in the episode: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude_journal">gratitude journal</a>, forcing oneself to converse with other people (on the street, on the train, etc.), <a href="https://kripalu.org/resources/time-affluence-why-doing-less-makes-us-happier">time affluence</a>, putting one's phone away as much as possible, etc. There's still the problem of measuring happiness (whatever it is). Self-reporting seems like the obvious (i.e. easiest) method, but I guess it has many downsides (e.g. do we really know when we're happy?).</comments>

    <comments><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Williams">Bernard Williams</a>'s idea that, if we really try and maximize a utility function (well-being of a population, etc.), we sometimes have to go against some of our core values, is interesting. His two moral dilemmas (<a href="http://philosophy.gmgauthier.com/bernard-williams-moral-dilemmas-and-utilitarianism/">Jim and George</a>) were illuminating. Now, after hearing this episode, I'm still not convinced that utilitarianism or consequentialism are problematic as theories. It just means that they're hard to implement in real life situations. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VeryBadWizards/comments/84a5qp/ep_135_utilitarianism_moral_identity/">Some of the comments on Reddit were longer than usual</a>.</comments>

    <comments>The deontology vs utilitarianism dichotomy is a bit simplistic, I agree. It's easy for us, homo sapiens, to get outraged, especially on social media, as they're designed (via machine learning and/or evolutionary algorithms) to push our buttons. We have to be aware of those psychological and technological biases, and make the conscious effort to engage in civil discussions with people we disagree with. Realizing that people on social media are not necessarily a representative sample of the general population can help, too.</comments>

    <episode>Ask Me Anything #11</episode>
    <comments>Sam gave a very nuanced answer about the Lawrence Krauss situation. That was not easy, but he nailed it, in my opinion. The answer about the link between intelligence and well-being was interesting. I think some studies indicate that intelligence helps up to a point (i.e. an IQ of about 130). Then it gets more complicated (e.g. people are more likely to get depressed, etc.). I'm glad to hear Sam say good things about stoicism. It <em>is</em> a good philosophy and it has many similarities with Buddhism. It kinds of bother me, but I think I have to more or less agree with Sam about the ethics of inherited wealth. It was not a very detailed and practical answer, but he's right to say that we have to keep some incentives for people to produce value for society and that includes the possibility to earn (possibly a lot of) money that can be inherited by our children.</comments>

    <comments>About circumcision: it has almost nothing to do with female genital mutilation, which is way worse, but I'm still against it, except in case of medical indication. Can a notepad, a smartphone or even the entire internet be considered as an "extended mind"? This is an interesting question. Quickly retrieving some information from the internet using our smartphones is not totally unlike retrieving some information from our (biological) memory by thinking hard about it. It's different, but not totally. Except that if you lose your notepad or smartphone, you still have your brain, but it's hard to "lose your brain" (maybe if you're drunk or tired?). Also, some people know how to find information on the internet more easily than others. Especially <em>true</em> information. So having access to the internet is not enough. You have to know how to apply your critical thinking skills.</comments>

    <comments>About the conceptual penis hoax: Tamler and Dave think "the hoax does not succeed in demonstrating what the authors purport it does", because the paper was published in a pay-to-publish journal. I agree with them and I don't understand what the big deal is with that hoax. It's pretty lame. Actually, I'm disappointed in one of its authors, James Lindsay. I read two of his books and his last one was <a href="http://olivier.bruchez.name/books#2017-02-08">really average</a>. I wrote him an email and never got an answer. I guess he's not the kind of person interested in discussion... The second part of the episode was also interesting. How do you measure pain, pleasure, well-being, happiness, etc.? How do you compare them between people? If you use self-reported values (let's say on a scale from 0 to 100), this is problematic, because depending on one's personal experiences, a given value might have different meanings. If you've never given birth to a baby without pain medication or if you've never been shot, maybe you've never really experienced pain. Same thing for pleasure, happiness, etc. We know that people have such differences in taste buds in their tongue that they will taste the exact same food very differently. If it is true for very basic sensations, it's probably also true for very complex emotions, which will be even harder to measure objectively.</comments>

    <comments>A history lesson. 21<sup>th</sup> century (computers/internet) is a bit like 16<sup>th</sup> century (printing press). Both had new ways of spreading new ideas, very fast. This is a good thing, but it also has negative consequences (e.g. fake news, cyberterrorism, etc.). I like this idea what we should judge historical events compared to what could have happened instead (i.e. counterfactuals). Applied to Trump, it means that the Trump presidency is a way for many Americans to vent their frustrations (i.e. a catharsis). People will eventually realize that electing a populist is not a good solution. According to Ferguson, communism has really been tried over and over, and failed every time. About capitalism: although inequality has increased within countries, it has decreased between countries.</comments>

    <comments>Philosophy: it's an old field (more than 2000 years old), but has it "solved" any problem? How could we measure it? Then there's the problem that philosophy is not really tackling the "big questions" anymore (i.e. the meaning of life, etc.). In that sense, is it really "useful"? Doesn't philosophy spend too much time on defining and redefining words and questions? Psychology: there's the huge problem of replication (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis#In_psychology">replication crisis</a>). Then there's the problem that it sometimes make claims that are too broad/general. Some of the problems in psychology are widespread in science in general (e.g. modifying the hypothesis after analyzing the data, fraud, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging">p-hacking</a>, etc.).</comments>

    <comments>It's difficult to take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager">Pascal's Wager</a> completely seriously nowadays, but it's still a very interesting argument. The two main criticisms are that: 1) you can't decide to believe something if you don't already believe it (just like you can't decide to fall in love with somebody) 2) there are many religions, so why should we believe in the Christian God and not in the many other gods from other religions? I didn't know about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_mugging">Pascal's mugging</a> thought experiment. Highly unlikely events with high rewards or severe punishments are hard to reason about. Similarly, transformative experiences/decisions (having a child, etc.) are also hard to take rationally (how do you weigh complex choices?).</comments>

    <comments>An episode about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettier_problem">Gettier problem</a> ("Gettier-type counterexamples [...] challenged the long-held justified true belief (or JTB) account of knowledge"). I think I understand why Tamler thinks people have devoted too much time to this problem (which I knew nothing about before listening to this episode). At the same time, I don't have a problem with researchers/thinkers devoting a lot of time to "useless" problems, because you never really know beforehand what impact a research project/paper is actually going to have. A lot of people probably think we should devote less time to string theory, for example. Should we, though? I don't think so. That being said, after hearing Tamler/David's discussion, I fail to see what's particularly interesting in the justified true belief (JTB) position and, hence, in the Gettier problem. "Knowledge as justified true belief" looks like a simplistic way of defining knowledge. There's always some uncertainty about what we think we know. It's implicit. We could live in a simulation, for example. For me, there's always room for an alternate explanation, but, at some point, you have to decide what you believe is true, based on the information you have, and go with it.</comments>

Le rôle de la technologie est important : il est possible d'extraire plus d'information de supports physiques en les numérisant à l'aide de technologies plus récentes, plus sophistiquées. Il est donc important de conserver les supports physiques, même une fois numérisés. Ce ne sont que quelques-unes des considérations à prendre en compte. Le sujet est complexe.</comments>

    <comments>Would you still decide to have a daughter if you knew she would die at a young age? Bonus question: if you could know exactly when you're going to die, would you prefer to know or to remain ignorant of the date of your death? <i>Arrival</i> was a good movie. I liked it. It's not the greatest science fiction movie ever made, but it's really good and beautiful. Like all movies with time paradoxes or time travel, it's full of inconsistencies (some of them I hadn't noticed), but it remains enjoyable nevertheless. One of the interesting aspects of the movie was how it dealt with the theme of language. It follows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity">Sapir–Whorf hypothesis</a> (i.e. "the structure of a language affects its speakers' world view or cognition."), which is a controversial, but intriguing hypothesis. It's pretty clear that having more words to describe the world is useful and makes us more attentive to some concepts/details. Some metaphors can also influence our behaviour (if you see a debate as a "war to win", for example). In the end, I don't know if I would have a child knowing that she/he would die at 16 and I'm not even sure I would like to know the date of my death, but the message in <i>Arrival</i> is clear: we should cherish the time we have (with our family, our friends, etc.), even if we don't always have the control on what happens in our lives.</comments>

People should have the right to protest and to express themselves, but physically preventing people to talk or physically assaulting them is always bad. Do these incidentes happen more lately, though? It's not clear. What's clear is that it's good for people (and especially young people) to feel bad about the ideas of other people. When someone disagrees with me, I often have to breathe and calm down before answering, so I understand why it's so upsetting to hear different views, but we all have to make conscious efforts to have better discussions, even with people with very different opinions.

    <comments>I agree that dreams are often a lazy way to explain something in a TV show or movie, but not always (e.g. David Lynch). I agree with Dave that saying death is like "before our birth" is not comforting. It's not the absence of consciousness that's scary. There's an asymmetry between the "death" before our birth and the death after our life: it sucks more to lose what you have than what you've never had. In that sense, death is always dramatic (when we're young, when we're middle-aged, and when we're old). Yes, it's more normal to die when you're old. If you're old and tired, it can even make death more appealing, but if you're old and healthy, then no amount of time is enough to make death seem less dramatic. About Buddhist monks being afraid of death: it's an intriguing paradox, but it can also be logical. By meditating, learning that the self is an illusion, being more grateful, learning to live in the moment, etc., you actually become better at "enjoying" life. It doesn't really change anything about death: to really accept death, you have to accept that it's somewhat a good thing. But how can you think death is a good thing if you enjoy life and are healthy?</comments>

Dillahunty was better here than last time (but not everyone agrees, it seems). This episode included some standard discussions/arguments about morality (is–ought problem, etc.), consciousness, free will, the (illusion of the) self, and meditation. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/7tq14j/115_sam_harris_lawrence_krauss_and_matt/dtfpip5/">This comment</a> probably sums up the discussion about free will pretty well: "Sometimes it gets really hard to parse what is a real difference of opinion and what just comes down to semantics."

    <comments>Most people will probably say that child sex dolls should be illegal and are unethical. As a consequentialist, I would say that it depends whether the consequences are good (i.e. it will lead a paedophile to not have sex with actual children) or bad (i.e. it will exacerbate the problem). I guess we don't have empirical data about this and, in the absence of any such data, it's probably a safe "bet" to make them illegal. Unfortunately, the problem will only get worse with virtual reality, realistic computer-generated videos, etc. The discussion about moral pluralism was hard to follow. I think I still don't understand what <a href="http://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/moral-pluralism">moral pluralism</a> is in practice. "Moral pluralism is the idea that there can be conflicting moral views that are each worthy of respect. [...] Moral pluralists believe that many moral issues are extremely complicated." It sounds like I might be a moral pluralist, then. Does it make sense to be a consequentialist in principle and a moral pluralist in practice? I'm not sure.</comments>

    <comments>Betting on our willpower to achieve our goals is a bad idea. This is not a new observation. Scott Adams says we should bet on systems, for example. For DeSteno, we should develop positive emotional habits, as <a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/three_emotions_that_can_help_you_succeed_at_your_goals">he explains in this article</a>: "The problem is that when we are faced with choices between pleasure now and reward in the future, we will often choose the former. [...] I propose that you cultivate the positive emotions of gratitude, compassion, and pride. Why these emotions? Because they evolved to help us act in "prosocial" (kind and helpful) ways, effortlessly bringing out our better natures and encouraging a long-term view of our present-day actions. And these emotions have three advantages over reason, habits, and willpower: Their strength doesn't wane after repeated use, they can't be hijacked to favor immediate rewards, and they improve our decisions in different areas of life at the same time." There's a "a connection between daily gratitude and greater average patience and self-control." Writing a gratitude journal can help. And you don't need to feel gratitude towards someone: "Even luck [...] can lead to a feeling of gratitude." Compassion for our future self and self-compassion can help, and meditation can be used to encourage compassion. Finally, "authentic pride" can help, too, so it's important to realize that "we learn from our mistakes and that effort matters".</comments>

    <episode number="41">The ethics of having children</episode>
    <comments>A topic that's very relevant to me at this time in my life. I agree that David Benatar's argument is not totally convincing (see <a href="http://olivier.bruchez.name/podcasts#2017-12-14">my comments</a>). I agree that the average/potential happiness of a child will depend on the parents, country, etc., so we probably can't say, globally, that people should stop reproducing. We need to be more nuanced than that. We can't make it illegal to have children or require parenting permits. This is not practical. So, yes, we need indirect measures (sex education, education in general, etc.). The discussion about the environmental impact of a child was a good start, but probably a bit too optimistic. I sense that there is a bias towards thinking that our children will have a positive impact on the world. Also, the fact that people in India are not as starved as anticipated several decades ago is not the whole story. Yes, we have more effective agricultural techniques, but what are their impact on the environment? Are they sustainable? I'm not so sure they are. A few important points also missing from this discussion: adoption (and the fact that there are more than 100 million orphans at any given time), parents' happiness, the effect of the number of children you have (1, 2, or more), etc. Studies have been done on these variables/effects and should probably be taken into account when deciding whether you should have children and, if so, how many you should have.</comments>

    <comments>The second interview with Robert Wright that I listen to (the first one being the interview on the Sam Harris podcast). I like how Wright describes meditation as a way to become more aware of our evolutionary biases (moral values, emotions, etc.). Evolution doesn't want us to be happy; it wants us to reproduce, to copy our genes. For that, it kind of needs us to be unhappy, to be always struggling, unsatisfied. For Buddhism, seing things as they really are can lead to happiness and make us better persons. Is it really true, though? This is an empirical question. Do we have any data about this?</comments>

    <comments>A dense discussion about one of my favorite topics. I found it difficult to follow Sam and Seth at times. If I had to listen to an episode several times, this would be one of them. Seth is the second person to reject some of Chalmers' ideas, mainly the <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Hard_problem_of_consciousness">hard problem of consciousness</a> (i.e. "we have moved on since the 90s", focusing on conceivability is a bit naive, etc.). Seth's take on vitalism: we used to think that life was a mystery, but it's a bit too easy to find our modern explanation "obvious" now, in hindsight; consciousness could be the same. Seth is not convinced that we will still have a hard problem "at the end", when we have a detailed model of the brain. Consciousness in non-human animals: it seems that I have the same intuitions as Seth, i.e. mammals are almost certainly conscious; birds are probably conscious; he's not sure about fishes and even less sure about insects; but consciousness is a gradual phenomenon. I didn't completely understand the concept of a Bayesian brain, that the brain is constanstly trying to predict perceptions. It reminds me of the idea of Geoffrey Hinton's Capsule Networks. We don't notice gradual changes, so we tend to overestimate the stability of our self. For the same reason, we might not notice a gradual decrease of our consciousness if we gradually replace our biological neurons with silicon neurons, so we shouldn't necessarily trust our intuitions when thinking about this kind of thought experiments. Seth is not convinced by the philosophical zombie argument, but for him it doesn't mean that AI has to be exactly like human intelligence; for him we can have AI agents without any consciousness (if I understand correctly). I don't know where I first heard about Giulio Tononi's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_information_theory">integrated information theory (IIT)</a> (probably in Christof Koch's book). Seth seems to think that we should explore this kind of models. I personally don't know/understand if this will lead us anywhere. For Seth, simulated consciousness is not necessarily possible and this matches my current intuitions. Can AI agents make us more psychopathic, à la <i>Westworld</i>? Are children giving orders to Alexa/Siri without saying "please" problematic? It might be. Again, according to Seth, our loss of empathy can be gradual, so this is something that might happen without us even noticing it.</comments>

    <comments>Eric Weinstein sounds very intelligent and interesting, but this configuration (three persons) didn't really work. I liked the discussion with Bret Weinstein better and I'm pretty sure that a one-on-one discussion with Ben Shapiro would be more interesting as well (I was definitely not impressed by him here). Still, it's a good thing that Sam and Ben had a public discussion. They agree about free speech. They disagree about religion and free will. The discussion was not always interesting in this case, but it's important that people with different views still debate together, in the most open and honest way possible. Ben was obviously wrong or incoherent about a couple of points: no free will doesn't imply that you don't act and he can't seem to grasp how it's completely arbitrary that he's Jewish. Also, I'm always surprised to hear intelligent people mention the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmoved_mover">unmoved mover</a> concept as a serious proof for God's existence. Sam's position about reason being linked to intuitions/emotions ("you cannnot help but be convinced by a good argument") is important.</comments>

    <comments><p>According to the paper mentioned in that episode, children that lie tend to be more intelligent than others. Should we encourage our children to lie more? Of course not. Lying is just one of many metrics you can use as a correlate for intelligence. There are many other things that you <i>should</i> encourage before lying.</p><p>About the <i>Black Mirror</i> episodes: I was expecting a discussion about the feasibility of artificial consciousness, philosophical zombies, etc., but I guess Dave and Tamler's discussion was a good start. They mentioned the fact that it's impossible to duplicate a person with all her/his memories using just her/his DNA (it's so obvious I don't know what the writers were thinking...). Sam Harris' idea that morality matters only when we're talking about conscious creatures/entities was, I think, briefly mentioned. The part of the discussion about punishment and what it means to punish a (conscious) digital copy of a person was interesting. I think that, at this point, they should have mentioned free will, though. If it doesn't make any sense to punish a copy of someone, does it make sense to punish the "original"? Of course, here, it's all about the psychological "benefits" of revenge, not about its effects on the "guilty" persons and on society as a whole. I already mentioned that <a href="http://olivier.bruchez.name/podcasts#2017-09-01">artificially conscious agents created with the goal of maximizing suffering is one of my worst nightmares</a>. Think about a conscious entity suffering at the maximum level at all time, continually, for billion of years, in a virtual environment where this entity cannot do anything but suffer (including choosing to die / committing suicide). Now think about a billion of those entities. What's the limit? "USS Callister" and "Black Museum" came pretty close to this idea of "artificial torture". It's important to have those very abstract / difficult concepts presented in a TV show. I think they might introduce them to more people and that the vital discussion about consciousness, morality, artificial intelligence/consciousness, etc. will grow.</p></comments>

    <comments><p>About personal identity: I was glad/intrigued to hear Paul Bloom talk about some people that have different intuitions, in particular about what matters or what should matter (if I understood correctly). Should we fear death by a teleporter, knowing that we're usually okay with sleeping and that we lose consciousness every night? Knowing that we're not really the same persons as we were 20-30 years ago? Yes, there's a physical continuity in the case of sleep, but without being a dualist, if I understand correctly (again), particles/atoms don't have what we could call an identity, so there's nothing special about the fact that our brains are made of a certain set of particles/atoms. Is there anything intrinsically bad about death knowing that we're all going to die someday? Also, should we be that interested in mind uploading if we're making copies of ourselves and not "transfering" any dualist soul? In summary, I still can't wrap my head around the fact that: 1) the soul doesn't exist 2) we seem to be our brains 3) the actual matter in our brains change over time (really?). I think our intuitions are wrong here, including Dave and Tamler's. I really need to read Derek Parfit.</p><p>About <i>Mr. Robot</i>: I guess I'm starting to agree that there should be only four seasons. I really hope that Sam Esmail has a real ending in mind and that the show won't end in a disappointing way like <i>Lost</i>.</p><p>About dehumanization: one the one hand, being more humane doesn't magically leads to more good; violence often comes from lack of control. On the other hand, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VeryBadWizards/posts/1547784538640508">as someone wrote on Facebook</a>: "We have glaring examples all around us that indicate that understanding the humanity of another individual is a laborious and skillful process; we shouldn't assume that everybody has completed this process for everybody on the planet. [...] We are born being able to see individuals as agentic beings and therefore consider strategies about how to interact with them to our advantage (whether through violent or pro-social behaviors), but seeing their humanity (and the "humanity" of animals) is a process which relies on a seed (of varying viability for different people) of empathy and cultivation of that seed (both by the individual and the society)."</p></comments>

    <comments>Quite a technical episode. What I retain from it is that meditation is probably not useful for physical problems and barely useful for mental problems such as regular depression, for example. Also, using meditation specifically for its side effects on well-being, relaxation, etc. might be counterproductive, as it can lead to unrealistic expectations. I guess we should focus on its usefulness as a tool to better understand ourselves.</comments>

    <comments>I like the idea of changing habits, trying out new things, in a kind of extreme way, and seeing what works and what doesn't. Timothy Ferriss does that, too, but I like him less and less with time. Jacobs is a vegetarian, so I definitely feel closer to him (i.e. there is an ethical / empathic sensitivity to his approach that I don't find in Ferriss'). I might be interested in his book <i>Drop Dead Healthy</i>, but it seems that Jacobs feels that there aren't many pieces of health advice to give and they're always the same (exercise, eat well, mostly vegetables, sleep enough, regulate your stress, etc.), so reading another book on health might not be very useful to me at this point. Hearing Jacobs talk about germophobia made me think about the fact that I wash my hands very often. I'm not sure it's a bad thing, though. The bit about radical honesty was fun. I guess a simple rule might be that we should say something if it is true, useful, and, in the case of a fact or judgement about a person, if it is something we would say in the presence of that person. About genealogy: I haven't been very interested in that subject so far. I have been more intrigued by the idea of analyzing my DNA to get some insights about my health. But the idea of a huge family tree with billions of persons sounds intriguing. If I remember correctly, Sam used his "happy cow farm" ethical argument once again in this episode. I wish someone would explain to him why it's not a good argument (because we're so far from a "happy cow" situation that it's a misleading argument, because it's not practical/scalable, because a cow, happy or not, is still using energy and emitting greenhouse gases, etc.).</comments>

    <comments>A lot of interesting ideas in this episode. Daniel Miessler has <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/analysis-sam-harris-podcast-bret-weinstein/">a summary on his blog</a>. This is old news for many people, but don't talk about races; talk about populations. It's a difficult concept, but one that makes sense from a biological point of view. Some differences between populations do exist and can be explained in evolutionary terms (e.g. Ethiopians and Kenyans marathon runners). Differences between sexes exist as well, but we shouldn't assume that they are biological differences. They most probably are cultural differences, as "we are the most nurture-based creatures in history." The concept of metaphorical truth is important. As Daniel put it: "Metaphorical truth is a belief that is factually wrong but you come out ahead if you believe in it." Religion: it used to be useful, but "we're now at a point where it (often) hurts more than it helps". I'm disappointed by Sam going back to eating meat. He sounds like he didn't take this seriously and didn't discuss his problems with a doctor. He doesn't mention any blood analysis or rigorous testing. He even admits that he might be victim of a placebo effect. Yep: disappointing. "If you stop eating farm animals they go extinct." Weinstein says this like this is a bad thing, but it's not, unless I'm missing something. It sounds like an excuse from someone who doesn't want to change. I like Daniel's conclusion: "Evolution's purpose for us is bad. It's basically to survive and reproduce at the expense of everyone else." All in all, Bret Weinstein sounds like a very smart and articulate person. I will keep an eye on him.</comments>

    <comments>This was a hard one. First of all, because I didn't think the discussion/interview was particularly well structured; it was really hard to follow. Then, when it comes to free will, I'm a determinist more than a compatibilist, although I think I understand the compatibilist position pretty well. I also understand that the determinist position is not very useful in practice, when we're talking about justice. So one of the main questions in this episode was: does oppression reduce the number of degrees of freedom of an agent/person? Does it reduce his/her culpability? If so, in what way? Maybe I was too tired, but I didn't think the discussion was very illuminating.</comments>

    <comments>I learned a new word: grandstand ("to behave dramatically or showily to impress an audience or observers; to pander to a crowd."). In French, we could say "jouer pour la galerie" or "faire l'intéressant". "Moral grandstanding" would be translated to "grandiloquence morale". This is something I have to resist doing, especially when it comes to vegetarianism/veganism (am I doing this again, right here?). I'm always torn between just doing the right thing, giving money to associations ("fighting" for me), and shutting up, on the one hand, and preaching (and, thus, annoying people), on the other hand. There's a hard balance to find between the two. Moral signaling is probably something deeply ingrained in us. We want to belong to groups that think like us. I guess the lesson is that we have to try and to be as humble as possible.</comments>

    <episode url="https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/is-life-actually-worth-living" number="107">Is Life Actually Worth Living? - A Conversation with David Benatar</episode>
    <comments><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinatalism">Antinatalism</a> is something I had already heard about, but this is the first time I hear somebody defending the position. I'm sympathetic to the idea that having children is something that people do way too easily, without even thinking about it. There are way too many people on this planet. We're polluting it, exhausting its resources, etc. Also, at any moment, there are more than 100 million orphans in the world. So my reasoning has more to do with the negative impact of a child on the world, including existing people and, in particular, the parents themselves. Benatar's position is based on several asymmetries. A good explanation (I think) of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/7hukcj/107_is_life_actually_worth_living/dqxk8oi/">one of those asymmetries</a> was given on Reddit. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/7hukcj/107_is_life_actually_worth_living/dr4vniz/">A good refutation</a> is also given (by the same person). So this is one of the problems I see with this assumption that there's a fundamental asymmetry: it's only an asymmetry because you intuitively think it is one (?). Or at least because you're asking a biased question. Sam was, I think, right to ask Benatar if his personal experience was tainting his reasoning/intuition. Benatar refused to answer. I also didn't understand why Benatar can be an anti-natalist but not a pro-mortalist. Not going from non-existing to existing is good, but going from existing to non-existing is inherently bad? Benatar used the movie analogy to explain his position. If you're at a movie theatre, watching a bad movie, you will probably resist the urge to get up and exit, because, maybe, you think, the movie is going to get better at some point. Now, if at the end of the movie, you realize that the movie was really bad, then you probably think that you shouldn't have started watching the movie in the first place. It's another asymmetry, according to him. But how does Benatar come to the conclusion that we're watching a bad movie? That our lives are barely worth living or not worth living at all? It's not clear. He also didn't answer clearly when Sam presented its instant/painless death thought experiment. This was frustrating. I also agree with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/7hukcj/107_is_life_actually_worth_living/dqv3ok6/">another person on Reddit</a>: the Mars analogy was not helpful. We don't think much about the absence of lives on Mars, but we actually don't think much equally about the absence of lives, happiness, or suffering on Mars. I don't think there's an asymmetry here or at least not a strong or useful asymmetry. All in all, I'm not convinced by Benatar. I agree that it's not obvious that we should have children. I agree that it's not obvious that life has meaning. But I don't agree with his reasoning. Of course, there's still the very likely possibility that I don't understand what he's actually saying. One thing is certain: this is a somewhat depressing topic, but a very imporant one. Also, I realize that it's very hard to reason clearly about non-existing consciousness / non-existing conscious beings.</comments>

    <comments>I agree with pretty much everything that's been said during the episode. You don't choose where you were born. If you live in a good country, with a good education system, a good economy, etc., then, great, be happy you were not born in North Korea. But being <em>proud</em> of something you didn't do is just weird. If you live in a great country, then you probably have nothing to do with it. And there are other countries on the planet. Some of them are good as well. Some are even better than your country, possibly. Now, patriotism certainly had some utility from a historic point of view, when nations were born, to gather communities/tribes together, but it's like religion: yes, it might have had <em>some</em> utility, at some point, but it's currently suboptimal (in the better case). I don't agree that there can be "cute" patriotism or religion. There's always a downside to those simplistic views.</comments>

    <comments>I kind of struggled with what Louis CK did (I wrote <a href="https://bruchez.blogspot.ch/2017/12/luvre-et-lartiste-metoo.html">an article about it</a>). This episode helped me clarify my position. I agree that we're not in a "sex panic" yet, but I see how we could get there, so we have to be careful. Not all men are bad. Not all women can be trusted. The part about Thomas Nagel' paper was interesting, but harder for me to follow. Again, I think the point of view of a computer scientist can help. I disagree with Tamler (and David?) about the fact that our intuitions and our wisdom cannot be modeled by algorithms. Not by simple, naive algorithms, no, but by more complex algorithms, such as neural networks. Modern machine learning / deep learning algorithms are still crude, but they can already learn and model complex and fuzzy data sets. The problem is that they then become "black boxes": we don't know how they learned what they learned. So, yes, it's easier for humans to come up with simple, discrete, "fragmented" values, but it doesn't mean, in my opinion, that a more complex, harder-to-understand unified system is not possible, in principle. If utilitarianism is about simple utility functions, then, yes, utilitarianism is wrong. If utilitarianism can use complex utility functions that don't necessarily make sense to humans, then I think it can still be true. That's my intuition, at least. Again, Nagel sounds like someone I should read. He doesn't seem put off by hard, (currently) unsolvable problems.</comments>

    <comments>Again, I think Kurzweil was onto something. It took 15 years for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Genome_Project">Human Genome Project</a> to be completed. And then, during more than 10 years, almost nothing happened (I'm oversimplifying, here). But now, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR#Cas9">CRISPR-Cas9</a> is there and it looks like it could change everything, very quickly. So, this is the usual slow-phase-followed-by-rapid-change Kurzweil has always been talking about. Doudna is not convinced that we will be able to change things such as intelligence in the short term (because it depends on dozens or hundreds of genes and changing them could lead to unexpected downsides), but there are a lot of clear applications that could appear in a few years already. Again, Kurzweil warned that experts are often less worried about advances in their field (it was the case with artificial intelligence and it appears to be the case here as well). So, as usual, technology advances and the public debate is lagging behind. Most people have absolutely no idea what's happening. This is frightening, in a sense.</comments>

You could even say he was thought-provoking, which is positive. To quote myself: "In the end, I still don't know why Scott Adams defends Trump as much as he does. Is he trying to make people (on the left, especially) see things from a different perspective? Is he trying to sell as many ads on his blog as possible? Is he trying to make his next book as successful as possible? I don't know. It doesn't really make sense." In that respect, I find Alex's view a bit too charitable.</comments>

    <comments>Not a very good episode. Tamler is constantly reminding the listener that he used to be a free will incompatibilist/skeptic, but that he's now an "enlightened" compatibilist. Yes, I know, this is supposed to be funny (maybe), but it's also annoying, because of another problem: when talking about Sam Harris' position, they're actually attacking a straw man, unless I'm really missing something. They're doing exactly <a href="https://bruchez.blogspot.com/2016/07/daniel-dennett-les-philosophes-et-les.html">what Dennett has been doing in the past</a>, pretending that "[Harris, Coyne, etc.] want us to completely abandon punishment". Quoting Harris and proving that it's a straw man: <a href="https://www.quora.com/Free-Will-What-are-the-differences-between-Sam-Harriss-determinism-and-Dan-Dennetts-compatibalism-Which-do-you-agree-with-and-why">"I agree that punishment might be practically necessary in certain cases (as it might be the only way to get people to behave)"</a>. So Tamler, and maybe David as well, are annoyingly condescending, here. And factually incorrect. Also, I'm tired of the "Nahmias" position on people's intuitions about free will.

    <comments>I enjoyed the part about the Black Mirror episode <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Junipero"><i>San Junipero</i></a>, which was an episode I really liked. It's partly dark, partly happy, but not in a clear way. You don't really know what to think of it. It's about healthcare, death, love, the meaning of life, virtual reality, mind uploading, and probably many other things as well. The way virtual reality is portrayed is plausible. Simulating whole universes where real people can meet and interact is already a thing. Doing it in a more realistic way, with more complex brain-machine interfaces that could lead to "simulated" pain, pleasure, etc. is, I bet, something that will happen. Now, mind uploading is another problem. David and Tamler are not convinced that it's possible. The argument is the same as the "teleporter as a suicide machine". I still don't know what to think. Another intriguing question, raised by the Black Mirror episode, is the following: can life be meaningful if it doesn't really end? Can an artificial life or artificial "heaven" where you cannot die be meaningful? My current answer would be: yes, but probably not with our current psychology. Still, I think you can have your cake (immortality) and eat it (meaning).</comments>

    <comments>The parallel between free will and art/sports didn't really work for me, but it's interesting. I usually don't care whether artists or athletes deserve blame/praise or awards/medals. I don't have any interest in sport, but I listen to music, watch movies, visit museums, etc., because I enjoy good music, good movies, good paintings, etc. I associate artists with what they produce only in the sense that it helps me discover more good music, good movies, etc., but I don't feel the need to blame artists if they produce bad art. I just ignore them. Now, bad moral behavior is something entirely different: it can be dangerous to society. So we use blame as a signal: don't do that; we don't want you to do that. So, am I a compatibilist? I don't know. Maybe. I still think determinism is a very important concept when talking about ethics and not when talking about art, because if we blame somebody, we have to do it pragmatically, but we have to do it very carefuly, recognizing that if she did what she did, at a given point in time, she couldn't have done otherwise in the "absolute" sense, only in the "local" / "degrees of freedom" sense. A good quote from Facebook: "the key difference, which you somewhat hovered around is that in the aesthetic case we are using accolades and calling for recognition, not making statements regarding character attributions, on top of encouragement which is common to both."</comments>

    <comments>I'm less familiar with Matt Dillahunty and, judging by the audience questions at the end, most people are way more familiar with Sam and Richard. If I have the opportunity, I might want to go to one of those "live events" one day, but hearing an audio recording of this event is a weird experience.

    <comments>For once, I didn't disagree with David and Tamler about free will. Yes, we have to accept both the reality of determinism (microscopic/physical view) and the reality that our brains don't see people as things and don't see people's actions as just physical events (macroscopic/societal view). Our brains evolved to understand the world as a place with agents having intentions, not as a place composed of a large number of particles interacting in a very complex and chaotic way. Are we completely constrained by our brains? Maybe. Maybe not. Apparently, some people can use meditation to really see that there's no limit between the self and the rest of the world, and that thoughts just happen (i.e. that there's no thinking self having those thoughts). Anyway, Thomas Nagel really sounds like a very clever philosopher. I should read one of his books or papers someday. I like how he doesn't feel the need to resolve the tension he describes in his paper.</comments>

    <comments>Not a fun topic, but something I think about a lot, especially lately. I guess we need more people like Ostaseski, who help people who are very ill and going to die soon. But we're all going to die soon, if we really think about it. So I agree that it should change how we choose to live. And most people prefer not to think about it. Because, yes, it's not fun. The only thing in this conversation that I found a bit cringeworthy is Ostaseski's idea that "we don't know" what happens after we die. Well, yes, technically, we don't know. Just like we don't know if God exists, if Russell's teapot exists, etc. But we can have a pretty good idea. So far, science tells us that there's nothing, because we are our bodies, we are our brains, and our bodies and brains decompose after we die. It's not complicated, actually. It's the usual agnosticism vs atheism debate. Come on: you're probably not really agnostic, you're an atheist; just admit it!</comments>

    <comments>The more I think about the "teleporter as a suicide machine" concept, the less I'm sure what I think about it. Isn't the fact that our intuition tells us that teleporting somebody is equivalent to killing her/him the same as having a dualistic view of the mind/body (substance dualism)? I should probably write a blog post about this (consciousness, identity, teleporting, mind uploading, death, etc.). The part of the episode about emotions was interesting to me, because I realized there's a parallel to be made between the emotion-language or color-language mapping problems and the algorithmic problem of clustering n-dimensional points/vectors (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">k-means clustering</a>, etc.). How do you choose the number of clusters? How do you define the distance between two points/vectors? And, then, how do you map those clusters to human concepts? Could you use a neural network to do that? Isn't that approximately how our brains map raw emotions or sensory perceptions to linguistic concepts?</comments>

    <comments>Cognitive biases are a way for our brains to keep a set of more coherent beliefs, to have more "easily retrievable" beliefs. Complex sets of nuanced or even contradictory beliefs are harder to manage for our brains. This has the obvious drawback of making our beliefs harder to change. There's a parallel to be made with governments or tribes, who tend to be resistant to changes coming from the outside but also from the inside (intolerance for individuals that behave differently, against the rules, etc.), which makes them easier to govern. This is a question of trade-off, as cognitive biases also make us hold beliefs that are simply not true. I guess I should read <i>The Totalitarian Ego</i>. It sounds like an interesting paper.</comments>

    <comments>The moral dilemmas at the beginning were fun. People have very different moral intuitions. As often, I tend to agree more with David. I would also pay $100 to make my next child more intelligent (by one standard deviation), but I'm ready to bet that a lot of people I know would be against it. Another proof that appeal to nature is hard to escape, I guess. The case of the anti-gay baker was definitely not a "no-brainer" for me. Absurdism is a topic I'm highly interested in. I read <i>Le Mythe de Sisyphe</i> by Camus in 2013. Like David (again), I tend to be regularly depressed when realizing the absurdity of life (i.e. the absence of "ultimate" meaning in life). Some people find it easy to not think too much about it. Or have commited a philosophical suicide (to use a terminology introduced by Camus) by embracing religions. Not me. I liked the interpretation that "nothing is important" can be depressing, but it can also help us overcome arguments and put our problem in perspective.</comments>

I don't see the controversy there. His answers about Black Lives Matter and feminism boil down to: identity politics is generally bad. His answers about guns, free will, and Hume's Is-Ought distinction are nothing new and are consistent with his books and blog posts / F.A.Q.</comments>

    <comments>One of my favorite "related artist" project. Another fun episode. The Peach &amp; Black team is right: this is a weird project. The band only performed live once. It's actually a Prince-Eric Leeds-Clare Fisher collaboration, not a band effort. <i>Yes</i> and <i>Susannah's Pajamas</i> are prototypes of what Madhouse would do later. Another weird thing: the version of <i>Nothing Compares 2 U</i> on that album is the first version of that song that was ever released, 5 years before Sinéad O'Connor's version and 8 years before Prince's own live version. This is also the weakest of those three versions.</comments>

    <comments>I've always thought that, as human beings, we have more in common than not. More than that, we have a lot in common with non-human animals and even plants! I don't like it when people say or imply that I cannot understand them because I haven't had the same life path as them. It doesn't make sense. About freedom of speech on US campuses: Sam is agnostic about the current trend; an <a href="https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/10/daily-chart-11">article from The Economist</a> seems to indicate that "young Americans who have attended college are in fact more accommodating of controversial speakers", but that a "vocal minority can have a chilling effect on what everyone else thinks they can say". I like how Christakis thinks it's important to listen to students, answer them in the best possible way, stay civil, etc. He's setting an excellent example. His research about how we can influence the behaviour of a group of people, using artificial agents, sounds exciting. This has so many applications in "real life", as well as online (Twitter mobbing, etc.). I personally would be interested in knowking how to convince people to become more interested in ethical concerns (veganism, etc.), for example. The way Christakis explained how we can escape local optima in optimization problems (i.e. by adding some kind of noise) was pretty good. This is nothing new, of course, and this is a concept we find in many processes (mutations in genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, etc.).</comments>

Now I'm not sure I'm convinced that any country would really want to "play nice" during an armed conflict. Yes, I'm aware of the Geneva Conventions, but I'm not sure the concept of <em>ethical war</em> really makes sense... The idea of simulating a war (instead of actually, physically going to war) is intriguing, but, ultimately, could only work in a context where countries have become mature enough to realize that war is useless.

    <comments>It's interesting to think about our intuitions about teleportation, identity, and death. The movie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prestige_(film)"><i>The Prestige</i></a> is illuminating in that respect. I agree that <a href="http://existentialcomics.com/comic/1">a teleporter is basically a suicide machine</a>. It doesn't matter if the reconstructed person at the other end of the teleporter says he's me. It could be an entirely different person; my intuitions shouldn't change. I agree with that. I've always wondered what this means for mind uploading. The logical conclusion seems to be that mind uploading is impossible (it would be another kind of suicide machine, after all). But, at the same time, this all sounds too dualist to me. I don't know how to completely reconcile the suicide machine intuition with the materialist view of the mind (i.e. we don't have a soul). I don't have much to say about the reason vs biases/impulses discussion. I agree with most of what was being said. Finally, is "biochemical Roombas" (Tamler) better than "biochemical puppets" (Sam Harris) as a metaphor for the fact that we don't have libertarian free will? I get it that in the case of the Roombas, it makes it clear that the decisions are made by an "internal algorithm" and not an "external agent", but internally or not, it doesn't really matter: the laws of physics are everywhere. And that's, in my opinion, the whole point of insisting that we're never completely free (absolute/libertarian freedom).</comments>

He has to be understanding, but not too empathic (really empathic or faking empathy, both are bad). He also has the very difficult task of explaining the statistics. Where the patient is located on a bell curve and why, etc. Other than that, I don't know what to retain from this episode. Statistically speaking, a lot of people around me will get cancer. I will maybe get cancer. This is depressing.

    <comments>Race is a fuzzy term. It doesn't correlate exactly with biological features. Sometimes it correlates more with cultural features. Sometimes, it's not clear which "race" (or, more exactly, ethnicity) you should belong to (e.g. latin vs black). For studies about intelligence, the race that is used is the self-reported race. Which means that it will sometimes include ethnicity or other more cultural concepts. Also, the obvious biological features we use to determine the race of a person (color of the skin, shape of the mouth, nose or eyes, hair color and texture, etc.) are just a small subset of the biological features we could actually use. So, that's one problem. Then, the scientific evidence shows that there are significant differences in mean IQ between races. This is a very sensitive topic. The question is: do those differences come from genetic differences or from environmental differences? If I understand correctly, this is an open question. David thinks that this is highly unlikely those differences come from genetic differences, because it is completely unlikely that the genes that encode visible differences that are clustered into races would be the same genes that influence intelligence. I'm not sure I understand his argument correctly, but I'm not convinced. Quoting a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VeryBadWizards/posts/1453227258096237?comment_id=1453986454686984">comment on Facebook</a>: "If you have a stable population for many generations, you should expect them to exhibit many internal similarities relative to other populations." So, in other words and if I understand correctly, is there a third (still genetic) variable to explain the correlation between race and IQ? Alessandro Vernet also wrote <a href="http://avernet.blogspot.ch/2017/09/very-bad-wizards-discussion-on-iq-and.html">a post on why he found David's argument unconvincing</a>. So the question remains, I think: is the race/IQ correlation explained by genetic or environmental differences (or both)?</comments>

I don't know if it's a conscious decision or not, but I think it's a good thing they're reviewing some of the weakest Prince projects "as a batch" (i.e. in 2017).

    <comments>The first part about the paper on dogs' desires and fMRI was interesting, in that it shows that research using fMRI often leads to simplistic conclusions. What does it mean to desire something? Are we "allowed" to have conflicting desires? In such cases, what does "real desire" mean? What does it mean for a dog to desire something? Is fMRI more robust than simply observing the dog's behavior? Anyway, it's a good thing that we're starting to take our pets' preferences when deciding who gets to keep them in a divorce, for example. The rest of the episode is about intelligence, the definition(s) of intelligence (e.g. "the ability to solve problems and learn"), the heritability of intelligence (which depends very roughly 50% on genes and 50% on the environment - but we don't know how precisely), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient">IQ</a>, how IQ is computed (normalized around 100), what IQ is correlated with (school/job performances, income, health, etc.), how IQ is determined (standardized, somewhat "well-guarded" tests), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect">Flynn effect</a>, the fact that IQ depends on more "static" things (e.g. vocabulary) and more "dynamic" things (e.g. reaction times), that it's difficult to change the environment to make IQ higher, etc. There are specific differences between sexes, but not overall (i.e. only when you consider particular types of intelligences, such as verbal vs spatial).</comments>

    <comments>A great discussion about consciousness, meditation, the self, etc. The existence bias mentioned by Metzinger is a useful concept (from an ethical point of view). I think I had never encountered it before. From Reddit: "existence bias is the tendency that conscious creatures have toward both continuing to live themselves and continuing the species in the future". From another comment (about Metzinger's thought experiment): "a god-like super-intelligence with perfect ethics and a perfect allignment of values with our own, determines that non-existence is ethically and even subjectively preferable to existence and [...] our own evolved bias towards continued conscious states is an illusion". I don't think I would completely agree with Metzinger about death and technology/AI, but another podcast would be needed for him to better explain his position. I agree with him that we should accept the reality of death more (this is the main idea in <a href="http://olivier.bruchez.name/books#2017-02-08"><i>Life in Light of Death</i></a> by James A. Lindsay), but I also agree with Yuval Noah Harari, who explains in <a href="http://olivier.bruchez.name/books#2017-08-26"><i>Homo Deus</i></a> that technology will eventually allow us to become gods. I agree that atheism (and "New Atheism" in particular) is somewhat shallow and that more is needed (a new kind of secular "spirituality" - see <a href="http://olivier.bruchez.name/books#2014-09-27"><i>Waking Up</i></a> by Sam Harris). The same thing can be said of some skeptics communities online. I don't know if Metzinger is correct to say that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness">hard problem of consciousness</a> is maybe not that worthy of our attention. But I'm glad that people as clever as him are still studying consciousness seriously. We need a model of consciousness to have better, more universal ethical theories.</comments>

    <comments>The first part, about the driverless car moral dilemmas, was funny, but it also highlights the fact that "trolley-like" thought experiments are often too simplistic and that it's hard to conclude anything useful from them. The rest of the episode was an Ask Me Anything / Q&amp;A.</comments>

    <comments>The fact that hundreds of millions of people will need to move because of sea level rise is frightening. For some reasons, I hadn't really realized this until now. Also, I must admit I was not aware that the fact that humans are the cause of climate change was such a scientific "consensus". Yes, I'm really ignorant when it comes to climate change, probably because it's such a politicized topic. It was refreshing to hear that we're on the right track when it comes to clean energy, electric cars, batteries, etc.</comments>

    <comments>This podcast has been recommended to me several times, so I'm giving it a chance, although I don't really have the time to listen to it regularly. This particular episode was about the 40 years of the Voyager space probes, among other things. The Voyager program has really cemented my interest in space and astronomy. The first pictures of Neptune I saw from Voyager II were absolutely gorgeous. These were really exciting times! All in all, this podcast seems interesting. I'm not sure I'll be able to listen to it regularly, but I'll try.</comments>

    <comments>Should <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> be censored in a middle school (because of the "N-word")? I agree that it shouldn't and that it's the opportunity to talk about a lot of complex and serious issues with the children and their parents (racism, language, art, etc.). Easier said than done, I guess. The part about "methodological terrorists" was also interesting. How should we handle methodological problems in a given field? Should people be more tactful? Should they express themselves on social media or use "official" channels only? At the end of the day, science is not about being nice, it's about discovering what's true or not in our world, so drama should be avoided as much as possible. The part about season 2 of Mr. Robot was especially interesting, because I'm not reading forums, blog posts, interviews, etc. about this show. Some of the theories discussed by Tamler and David were intriguing. It was the first time I really thought about this, actually. I watched season 2 in a short period of time this summer (over a bit more than two weeks) and put myself more in a kind of "contemplative mode", rather than an analytical mode. This is maybe a defense mechanism indirectly caused by <i>Lost</i>, among other things. Like many people, I was really disappointed by how that show ended (let's just say that it was not a particularly clever and/or coherent ending). I don't want <i>Mr. Robot</i> to be another <i>Lost</i>, so I unconsciously avoided thinking too much about it, about how it could make sense (i.e. what's real? what's not?).</comments>

    <comments>An episode about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem">is-ought problem</a>. So, yes, there is a gap between facts and values, and people disagree about the size of that gap. Is it a large gap? Or a very narrow gap? I'm not totally convinced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moral_Landscape">Sam Harris' argument</a> and I guess it would be stronger if he accepted to engage in actual philosophy and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-ethics">meta-ethics</a> (instead of dismissing that branch), but I tend to agree with him. He's on the right track. The fact-value gap is not that big. At least in principle. And that's maybe part of the problem when we're talking about meta-ethics. It's often not clear if we're talking about the ability to determine values in principle or in practice. This is a distinction I've not heard from David and Tamler. But at the end of the day, I think Harris is right: the gap we're talking about is not that wide and it's very likely that it can be bridged with a few axiomatic ideas (see Harris' health/medicine analogy).</comments>

    <comments>I was just wondering if I should buy <i>Life 3.0</i> or not. After listening to this episode, I think it might be an interesting book. Let's see if the reviews are good. The discussion about the concept of substrate independence and the wave anology was illuminating, at least for me. I'm glad Tegmark seems to think it's important to think about consciousness (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_consciousness">artificial consciousness</a>). One of my worst nightmares would be humanity creating AI agents that are considered unconscious (i.e. "zombies"), but that actually <em>are</em> conscious and suffering since they would be slaves having to work for us. My worst nightmare is people willingly creating artificially conscious agents with the goal of maximizing their suffering (i.e. "artificial suffering"). We <em>need</em> to come up with a good theory of how consciousness works, even if it's a really hard problem. Another important point is the fact that we need to start thinking positively about artificial intelligence, especially in science fiction, where a lot (most?) of the stories are about dystopias (e.g. killing robots, etc.).</comments>

    <comments>I liked how Sam tried to apply the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">"uncanny valley"</a> concept to another domain (discussions between people on different locations on the "moral spectrum" - or "moral landscape"). The part about why it's difficult/problematic to find values and meaning in a secular society (e.g. atheism, secularism and even humanism are not enough) was thought-provoking. We currently don't really have an alternative to religions, in particular when it comes to morality. And, according to my own, perfectly anecdotal experience, most people seem morally confused (i.e. for them, morality is some kind of fuzzy concept, everybody can have an opinion about what's good or not, etc.). I can't say I retained much from the rest of the discussion (about identity politics, etc.).</comments>

    <comments>This was a pretty good episode, until Sam basically started explaining Buddhism to David and Tamler. This last part was way too long. I liked the discussion about how Very Bad Wizards affects (or not) David and Tamler's professional life (i.e. how you can be irreverent, publically, on a podcast, and still have a "serious" professional position, with students, etc.). The discussion about mockery hasn't convinced me one way or the other. I guess it depends on the context. I also liked the part about how technology can change how we assess a moral dilemma (e.g. abortion).</comments>

    <comments>The discussion about free will was, of course, interesting. But I'm not sure it will advance the debate between compatibilists and determinists. We're doing good things or bad things because of how things are wired in our brains. "It's tumors all the way down", as Sam would say. But I don't think compatibilists would deny that. I really would like the discussion to go further (as I explained in a <a href="https://bruchez.blogspot.ch/2016/07/daniel-dennett-les-philosophes-et-les.html">blog post in French</a>). Apart from that, this was a very enjoyable discussion. Sapolsky sounds like a clear thinker/speaker. I should probably read his book.</comments>

    <comments>de Becker's message is perhaps not that bad, but the way he presents it is sometimes off-putting. For example: "I hate statistics." Me? I like good statistics. They're useful. If you know how to interpret them. Also, the way he seems to think we should listen to our intuitions more is weird. Intuitions are heuristics. They're a way to quickly come to a conclusion. But the speed of our intuitions comes at a price: intuitions are often wrong (e.g. we're all biased). So, yes, I understand that distrusting people more will lead to less "tissue damage", but I'm not concinved that we need a society where people distrust each other more. And I also understand that it's not exactly what de Becker is saying. But he should probably insist less on the intuition/reason dichotomy. I guess my takeaway is that we should learn how to use our in-the-moment intuitions as inputs, among other inputs, to decide whether a situation is dangerous or not. But it's not a very practical piece of advice. How do we tune our intuitions?</comments>

    <comments>David Brooks seems to defend virtue ethics and uses words such as "sin", arguing that they can be used in a non-religious sense. I didn't retain much from this discussion, as I see myself more as a consequentialist. I guess I accept the fact that virtues can have some value, but I see them more as heuristics that have survived the test of time. Like Sam, I'm pretty much convinced that you should lie as little as possible. But exceptions are always possible. The discussion about Patreon (before the actual interview) was also interesting: the community aspect of a platform such as Patreon is important.</comments>

    <comments>Another long (almost four hours!), fun episode, about the second disc (<i>From The Vault &amp; Previously Unreleased</i>) of the <i>Purple Rain Deluxe</i> release. Again, there are a lot of sound glitches/problems and errors in the liner notes for this disc, but, as Captain would say, "it is what it is". Most of the songs probably come from old cassettes stored at Warner Bros., so this was to be expected. All in all, this is the first official album of previously unreleased music by Prince, so this is an important release.</comments>

    <comments>Scott Adams likes to see the world through filters, patterns, etc. Using an analogy? You've run out of argument. This sometimes leads to lazy, frustrating oversimplifications. Other than that, Scott Adams is intelligent, but he gives a way too charitable interpretation of how Trump operates. I agree with Sam that Trump, more often than not, operates in a "whatever sticks, sticks" mode. He's not using a method. Unless you think the absence of a method is in itself a method. But Scott Adams will always find a way to justify what Trump does, using his "master persuader" filter. As someone said on Reddit, Scott Adams is "setting himself up to always be right". Also, the idea that something can be "not exactly true", but "true enough" (à la Jordan Peterson) or "emotionally true" is really an annoying idea. In the end, I still don't know why Scott Adams defends Trump as much as he does. Is he trying to make people (on the left, especially) see things from a different perspective? Is he trying to sell as many ads on his blog as possible? Is he trying to make his next book as successful as possible? I don't know. It doesn't really make sense.</comments>

    <comments>I'm not sure what to think about the part on Neal deGrasse Tyson's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/neil-degrasse-tyson/reflections-on-rationalia/10154399608556613/">Rationalia</a>. I had never heard/read anything about it before. So, the problem is that governments, politics, and, particularly, politicians suck. What can we do about it? Neal deGrasse Tyson's answer is to "inject" more science, more reason into governments. Yes, this is a bit naive: "The debate then ends quickly in the face of evidence, and we move on to other questions." My conclusion is that the idea, the intention is better than the (proposed) implementation. It's still better to have more reason, more evidence-based thinking, than not. But it won't be enough, as the second part shows: "David and Tamler discuss a recent paper by Dan Kahan and colleagues showing how prone people are to make errors in processing information to favor positions they are predisposed to believe. And even more shocking: the higher your numeracy skills, the more prone you are to fall prey to this bias." That's depressing. We're all biased. So, how do we know what's true and what's not? There's no silver bullet. Intelligent people are wrong. All the time. So we have to keep having civil discussions, with respect, humility, no sense of superiority, etc. And, yes, humor can be seen as a sign of humility (but not always, I would say).</comments>

    <comments>I absolutely <em>love</em> this idea that there are "simple" rules that we find at different scales of reality. The world is complex, but this is somewhat reassuring to know that some basic, underlying principles are simple. That's why I've always loved fractals, I guess. Now, does West's theory work or is he oversimplifying how biology and cities actually work (<a href="https://xkcd.com/793/">mandatory xkcd reference</a>)? <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQT3GP7W8NUFL/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1594205582">There seems to be some problems with the charts in his book, among other things</a>. Anyway, it's encouraging to hear that some principles can be found at various scales and work <em>at least to some degree</em>. I don't really expect longevity to be <em>stricly</em> linked with the size of an organism, but if there is a relationship between the two <em>on average</em>, then this is already intriguing.</comments>

What's the relationship between memory and personal identity? Even though we forget things, can we <em>intuitively</em> know/learn them? We constantly "rewrite" our past, consciously or not (e.g. self-deception), because we cannot remember everything. How can we know what's real or not? Can other people also manipulate us like we manipulate ourselves? Those are some of the many questions this movie raises.</comments>

    <comments>An episode "for supporters only". Not sure I like the idea. Sam answers my question about how he reads books at 56:00. The answer is not really illuminating. He doesn't really take many notes or organize them in a "rational" way. Basically, he reads on Kindle a lot and relies on his memory (whatever sticks, sticks). I like some of the advice he gave in other parts of the episode: don't be afraid to ask for help, ditch perfectionism (which is the same as fear, for him) and just do things, don't hesitate to change your mind about decisions you made earlier (almost nothing's for life), don't be afraid to <em>not</em> finish books you don't like, don't think too much about the meaning of life (be mindful instead), be as honest as possible (see <i>Lying</i>), etc. Sam doesn't listen much to music (not enough time, cannot work to music). He prefers non-fiction books (I do, too). He doesn't adhere to a strict daily schedule (but he's self-employed, so that's easier to work that way, I guess). He seems to like Aubrey de Grey, so he should really invite him.</comments>

    <comments>Is Europe commiting suicide by accepting too many immigrants? Should we defend our values more? What are "our values"? To quote a comment on Reddit: "The death of Europe being presented is not about the number of immigrants or the rate of such crimes, it's about the failure of our societies to react appropriately and instead to either acquiesce to, or even simply endorse, abandonment of our core values and moral principles in the name of tolerance and pluralism, no matter the cost." Sensitive topic, of course. The "western values" are not necessarily the "Judeo-Christian values" I often hear about (a weak and divisive concept, to say the least). We're talking about free speech (including the right to criticize religions), women's rights, LGBT rights, etc. It seems clear to me that we have a moral duty to accept as many people that need to flee their country as possible (refugees). It also seems clear to me that immigration has practical impacts, including negative ones. I don't know what the limit should be, but there needs to be one. No practical solutions were discussed in this episode, which is a bit frustrating.</comments>

It's overcompressed (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war">loudness war</a> on Wikipedia), like all Prince albums since <i>The Gold Experience</i> (1995).

I really like his studio work with Prince (<i>The Rainbow Children</i>, <i>Xpectation</i>, <i>N.E.W.S.</i>, and some of the tracks on <i>Musicology</i>). The Montreux 2009 concerts are also a highlight. I don't have much to say about the episode itself. The anecdotes were fun. The rest of the episode was serious, as expected.</comments>

    <comments>Disgust can be literal (the emotion) or metaphorical (e.g. used in a value judgement). In the second case, we don't really feel disgusted. It's easy to see how disgust has been selected by evolution to protect us against potentially dangerous foods or substances. What's interesting is that there's also a link between disgust, morality, and politics (e.g. liberals are less easily disgusted than conservatives on average). David did <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/david_pizarro_the_strange_politics_of_disgust">a TED talk</a> about this. Interestingly, the presence or absence of a feeling of disgust can even change a person's opinion about morality or politics. Emotions change how we think, even if we don't realize it.</comments>

Are there really people that can totally suppress their sadness when they lose somebody they love? I'm not sure that's what Stoics were aiming for... Anyway, unsurprisingly, Tamler and I seem to disagree about the importance of emotions (I would describe them as heuristics, in the computer science meaning of the term, leading to quick, but often wrong, "conclusions"), about Peter Singer, etc.</comments>

    <comments>I somehow feel that Sam is not too comfortable discussing Kurzweil's ideas. I know that Kurzweil can sound like a religious prophet to some, but I thought that Sam was a bit more nuanced than that. About the dangers of AI (the alignment problem, etc.): I don't agree with Kelly about the fact that "we have time to figure everything out". He keeps repeating that things won't happen overnight, but even if that's the case, it doesn't necessarily mean that we have plenty of time to think about those problems. Also, we'll know that people such as Sam Harris and Elon Musk, who think that we have to be very careful about AI, will have succeeded when, indeed, nothing too bad will have happened. But it's precisely because some people say we have to be very careful that things will go well. It won't mean they're wrong. I'm also disappointed by Kelly's reaction about automation and job losses: he seems to agree with the mainstream idea that we'll always find other tasks to do (I can't see how, unless we merge with machines) and that we can train almost everybody to do something else when a profession (e.g. truck driver) disappears. This is overly optimistic and dangerously wrong. His idea that we should experiment with universal basic income before implementing it at a large scale is also not very useful. Yes, maybe so, but, theoretically, what's the alternative? So, yes, a very disappointing episode. Also, I'd really like to hear Sam discuss the idea of artificial consciousness more. It's a very important topic.</comments>

I gave it a rather high score (4 out of 5). So, yes, this is a very good movie. At the time, I probably didn't think of all the themes discussed in this episode (the moral dilemma in the most important scene of the movie, the question of cowardice, instinctive vs conscious character, what can be or cannot be forgiven, what it means to forgive, etc.). Good movies are movies than can be watched several times and trigger rich discussions. I definitely need to watch it again.</comments>

    <comments>I must have been tired, because most of this episode went over my head. Some emotions (e.g. a white person having a negative reaction when seing a black person) are not necessarily representative of who we are, so, yes, emotions can be dumb (and often are). They tell us more about our (stupid) biases than about what we really believe to be true or good. I liked the first bit about what it means to be offended. How much of a given population needs to be offended for the offense to be "serious enough". One person? 10% 50% More? Do you really need to be offended to say that something is offensive?</comments>

This is a hard question. Sam's goal has never been to help "Muslims on the ground" so different approaches can coexist, e.g. Sam's and Maajid Nawaz'.</comments>

    <comments>I didn't know of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Masih_ad-Dajjal">Al-Masih ad-Dajjal ("the anti-christ")</a> and the role of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_Islam">Jesus in Islam</a>. That part was really entertaining. The fact that well-eduated people can become members of ISIS, because they're attracted/motivated by their <em>ideas</em>, not because they're poor, stupid or crazy, is frightening. But it's a reality. Wood reminds us that there aren't that many members of ISIS, though ("only" about 40,000, according to him) and that ISIS is slowly but surely becoming weaker, so it's still a worrying organization, but things will eventually get better. It was also interesting to hear that members of ISIS crave attention and will "gladly" give interviews to journalists (or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Todenh%C3%B6fer">welcome a German journalist to ISIS-controlled territories and let him leave safely</a>).</comments>

    <comments>"Should we use algorithms to influence decisions about criminal sentencing or parole decisions?" Yes, we should, as long as the algorithms work. And I agree with David that algorithms <em>can</em> be as good or better than humans at almost any task (and will be better at <em>any</em> task in the near future). The problem is the data you use to feed your machine learning / deep learning algorithms. If your data is "biased", then your algorithm will be biased, so you have to be very careful, especially when the life of people depends on it.</comments>

    <comments>As a vegetarian, I'm slightly "shocked" by the mouse/money experiment mentioned in this episode. At the same time, I'm not shocked at all that we associate different values/prices to different persons, animals, species, etc. This is expected when you introduce a market (i.e. capitalism). What's more interesting is that the value/price you associate with something (e.g. the life of a mouse) goes down when you deal with somebody and goes even lower when you deal with several persons (i.e. when you introduce more and more complex markets). This is not completely surprising. After all, not buying an iPhone won't change the fact that sweatshops exist, because, if you don't buy an iPhone, millions will buy one anyway. In other words, in a market, your moral responsability is somehow attenuated. About the swapping-baby thought experiment: I tend to agree with Tamler here; I'm not sure that it leads to particularly interesting conclusions / useful actions. At the same time, I'm convinced that we should tend as much as possible to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer">Singerian</a> morality. I'm more and more annoyed with this tendency to favor local people, local enterprises, etc. just because it's fashionable. It makes sense in a lot of cases, but not always.</comments>

I've always been on the fence about this, but banning the burqa/niqab would probably lead to more isolation for the women having to wear it. I'm still not convinced that openly allowing the burqa/niqab in the public space is a good idea, though. This is a complex issue.</comments>

I had never really thought about the difference between guilt (more private) and shame (more public), as well as their relationship. Also, it's interesting to think about how shame can be constructively used in public policies, etc. Being anonymous on the internet leads to less shame. That's a problem.</comments>

    <comments>A <em>very</em> controversial topic. Again, I'm happy that other people are discussing (toxic) topics such as this one. IQ tests predict something else than just the ability to do IQ tests (i.e. IQ is correlated with many other things). IQ tests don't seem to be biased toward a given culture. Race can be a valid biological concept, but a fuzzy one. You can see race as a kind of extended family. From a genetic point of view, we should probably use the word "population" instead of the (very) charged word "race". According to Murray, the difference between the mean IQ of whites and blacks is significant, but there's a huge overlap between the two bell curves, so you should never discriminate based on that knowledge (that there's a difference in the mean value). So the question remains: why discuss this topic at all? If you say something true, but very controversial/taboo and not very useful, shouldn't you expect the backlash you're getting? I don't think I understood Murray's answer (about positive discrimination, etc.). I had to read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/670yth/73_forbidden_knowledge/dgomv1i/">several comments on Reddit</a> to get an idea of what his position might be. Nevertheless, Murray's motivations don't seem bad. And I agree with Sam that the negative reactions he has received since 1994 are unjustified. In particular, what happened at Middlebury College is completely unacceptable. Finally, Murray's positive position on basic income is interesting, as he's a conservative and it contradicts the idea that people on the left are more in favor of basic income than people on the right.</comments>

    <comments>The small excerpt from a Prince interview at the beginning was nice. Tamler and David explain later in the episode that they're Prince fans (although not hardcore fans, I suspect). What can or should be discussed in philosophy: I tend to disagree with Tamler, here. Everything should be up for discussion. Even (especially!) things that are obvious (to "normal human beings"). Now, that doesn't mean that the book and review they're talking about in that episode are good. Tamler recommends "A History of Western Philosophy" by Bertrand Russel. I bought this book a few years ago. It's on my "to-read" list. I guess I really should read it, but I don't really know how (it's pretty long!). Tamler is not bothered by his finitude. <a href="https://bruchez.blogspot.ch/2016/07/daniel-dennett-les-philosophes-et-les.html">It's not the first time he says that.</a> I guess it explains why we have different positions on some topics (free will, maybe vengeance, etc.). The question of how we should (or can) appreciate the work of Roman Polanski, Woody Allen, or Bill Cosby is discussed again. An important (psychological) difference is whether you see the person in his work or not (e.g. it's impossible to watch "The Cosby Show" without actually seeing Bill Cosby). Is justice in part a substitute for vengeance?</comments>

    <comments>Attention economy is a fascinating topic! It's linked with many other topics: free will, cognitive biases, epistemology, skepticism, fake news, advertisement, psychological manipulation, etc. And, also, in a more indirect way: effective altruism, the <a href="http://olivier.bruchez.name/books#2017-04-30">meaning of life</a>, etc. "What should I do next?" or "How can I best spend my time?" are the most important questions we should ask ourselves. For me, the answer is never "spend 3 hours on Facebook", "play a game on my smartphone for the next 2 hours" or "watch live television". My time is precious and I'm getting more and more serious about how I want to spend it. The fact that people want to make us waste our time is revolting. Facebook and others are guilty of this, of course, but pre-Internet things such as television have been time wasters for a long time. In a completely different domain, I've also refused to serve in the Swiss army (a completely useless organization), for example. Some tools/systems I use to fight time wasters: GTD/to-do lists and reviews, diary/lifelogging, Feedly, lists on Twitter, <a href="http://bengrosser.com/projects/facebook-demetricator/">Demetricator</a> plugin for Facebook, not buying things without thinking about it for some time (e.g. 30 days), etc. An important thing is to become aware of our limitations (what Tristan Harris calls "human architecture"), which include <a href="https://betterhumans.coach.me/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18">cognitive biases</a>, among other things, and how people can exploit those limitations. I've only been aware of this since reading <a href="http://olivier.bruchez.name/books#2007-05-08">Petit traité de manipulation à l'usage des honnêtes gens"</a> ten years ago.</comments>

The part about quantum mechanics was a nice refresher, but, having already read quite a lot about the topic, I realize that I still don't undertand anything... The last part, about the danger of Christian vs Islamic fundamentalisms, was also interesting in the sense that Harris and Krauss seem to largely agree and, at the same time, arrive at different conclusions.</comments>

    <comments>I had never really thought about the fact that the way a criminal punishment is presented (to criminals, to society), the "story" behind it, its meaning, matters. Community service, for example, is problematic. Do we want to convey the idea, to criminals, to society, that serving our communities is a punishment (i.e. a bad thing)? Of course not, so we have to be careful in how we present this kind of alternative punishments (in that case, in insisting that this is a symbolic way to restitute something to society). About shame: I'm not convinced that it has to be part of punishments.</comments>

    <comments>A few discussions were related to how to do good science and good research. I had already mentioned a book I read 10 years ago, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petit_trait%C3%A9_de_manipulation_%C3%A0_l'usage_des_honn%C3%AAtes_gens">"Petit traité de manipulation à l'usage des honnêtes gens"</a>, which is mostly about priming studies (if I recall correctly) and I already was under the impression that most of those studies probably only indicate a weak effect. So, yes, priming studies are probably a bit "overrated". And often conducted using too few research participants, as many psychological studies. Speaking of "overrated", this probably applies to a lot of neuroscience studies as well, as was discussed with Laurie Santos. The discussion with Sam Harris was good, as usual. The two discussed topics are "old news" to me (artificial intelligence and vegetarianism). I mostly agree with Sam. As did Tamler and David, apparently.</comments>

I agree with some of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/617mn9/69_the_russia_connection/">comments on Reddit</a>: when it comes to politics, Sam seems to be a little out of his depth. There was nothing really bad about this episode, but nothing really good either. Yes, people such as Harris and Applebaum need to learn how to have better discussions with people who disagree with them. Maybe we need more psychological research in that direction. Some (simplistic) points I retain from this episode: Trumps likes Putin/Russia; in particular, Trump likes how Putin became a politician and used his political power to get even richer; Trump doesn't care about the United States' historical friends/allies; this can have a destabilizing effect on the rest of the world; the constant lies from Trump is something new for the US, but it's a tactic that has already been used many times in other parts of the world.</comments>

    <comments>Part of this episode is about the <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716">"Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science"</a> study from 2015, which attempted "to replicate 100 original studies that had been published in one of three top-tier psychology journals in 2008". "Depending on the criterion used, only 36 to 47% of the original studies were successfully replicated". Good science is hard. Good studies are hard. This is explained at length in Ben Goldacre's two excellent books <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Science_(book)">"Bad Science"</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Pharma">"Bad Pharma"</a>. I guess this is a good thing that psychology is trying to get better as a scientific field. Ever since I read <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petit_trait%C3%A9_de_manipulation_%C3%A0_l'usage_des_honn%C3%AAtes_gens">"Petit traité de manipulation à l'usage des honnêtes gens"</a>, I've been under the impression that psychological studies are usually conducted in universities with 20-30 students as research participants. This is a cliché, of course, but I'm not particularly surprised by the results of the 2015 study. We need more serious studies and we also need <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis">meta-analyses</a> to reach serious conclusions. Maybe we also need more educated researchers, as bad research is probably more often the result of incompetence than fraud (cf <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon's_razor">Hanlon's razor</a>). Other questions that have been discussed: is it moral to lie to children about Santa Claus? is it moral to lie to people in order to conduct a psychological study (which is done on a regular basis)? Personally, I think they have to be understood from a consequentialist standpoint.</comments>

    <comments><p>The introduction about how Sam's "fans" should or should not behave online (e.g. how they should be respectful of all the guests on Sam's podcast, even if their views don't make sense) was a bit weird. But I guess he's right. Discussions should always stay civil and constructive, online or not. The part about how Sam doesn't like ads and how only 1% of his listeners are giving money via Patreon, etc. was more interesting. I hate ads. Listening to the Tim Ferriss Show is painful to me in part because of ads. Currently, I'm giving money to five persons on Patreon. Sam is one of them. I really like this system. I actually wish I could support more people in that way (musicians, bloggers, etc.).</p><p>Harari tends to use words a bit loosely, so, for him, religions and ideologies have the same role from a historical perspective. Sam retorts that religions rely on supernatural claims, whereas ideologies usually rely on natural claims. They then discuss an example I've been thinking about for years: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">technological singularity</a>. Many people see this concept as a "techno-religion" (eternal life, mind uploading, etc.), so I've always been careful not to be too enthusiastic about it. At the same time, it's difficult <em>not</em> to believe that it will happen at some point. I agree that loss of meaning will be one of the hardest challenges to come (e.g. when people won't have to work, at least not as much as they currently have to). The disconnect between what we're "supposed" to do according to evolution and what we'll actually do will get larger with time. Things will probably get weirder. I'm also a bit concerned about virtual reality: I've met several people throughout my life who play video games a lot. Let's just say that I'm far from convinced that this is the best use of your time if you want to become someone interesting...</p></comments>

I also agree that we should be honest with children, as much as possible, even (especially!) when it comes to religious beliefs, and that children are probably more comfortable with ambiguity than we might imagine.</comments>

    <comments>The more I think about the Chinese room thought experiment, the more I think it's useful in showing how <em>not</em> to think about artificial intelligence. Our neurons, individually, do not "understand" our thoughts.

What makes us understand things? <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0470752/">Ex Machina</a> is more interesting in that it shows what an artificial intelligence can do when it is not (completely) aligned with human moral values. Or aligned with "psychopathic" values. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_control_problem">AI control problem</a>.

    <comments>It's impressive that two persons who really disagreed about something (during more than one hour!) can find the time and patience to make a second attempt at a constructive/civil discussion. This is a good example for everybody. A lot of thought-provoking questions are discussed. Can we transcend our genetic/evolutionary predispositions? As was discussed in <a href="http://olivier.bruchez.name/podcasts#2017-03-15">episode 61 of Very Bad Wizards</a>: if a person or a group of persons suffers from a pathology, can she/they still be said to have a meaningful experience? What's the relationship between truth and fiction? Sam's brilliant deep/spiritual/philosophical interpretation of a fish recipe was absolutely funny and at the same time weakened Peterson's position. Yes, there are "truths" to be found in fiction, including religious fictions, but those patterns are to be expected, as our brains all share the same structure, more or less. I still don't understand why Peterson insists that Christianity has a special value/role here. There are "truths" (or illuminating patterns, to be more precise) in almost all works of fiction, good ones (e.g. Dostoyevsky), but also bad ones. This is just a question of interpretation, as was demonstrated by Harris' fish recipe example.</comments>

    <comments>If we feel that our life is meaningful, is it a sufficient condition to say that our life is meaningful? Or are there more objective criteria to determine whether it is meaningful or not? I'm not sure there's any takeaway from this episode. My personal view is that life is "ultimately" meaningless. We will all die. Everybody we know will die. As I wrote in my comments for <a href="http://olivier.bruchez.name/books#2017-02-08">"Life in Light of Death"</a>: "Even if we manage to live longer and/or to upload our minds to machines, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_Earth#Solar_evolution">Earth will be destroyed by the Sun at some point in the future</a>. And even if we manage to move to another planetary system and/or galaxy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe">the universe will most probably die as well</a>." Can life be "locally meaningful" (e.g. as a social construct)? Yes, I think so. If so, is there any objective criterion for "local meaningfulness"? Such as what others think of what we do (our friends, our family, society in general, etc.)? Is it compatible with the fact that <a href="http://olivier.bruchez.name/books#2014-12-23">most of us are actually insignificant and will be completely forgotten in a few generations</a>? As Tamler said, "For every van Gogh, there's a million people who just suck.". The conclusion is that I don't really know how to embrace the fact that I'm both "locally meaningful" and "ultimately insignificant".</comments>

    <comments>The question of how we should approach the work of movie directors, for example, who did questionable things in their life (like Roman Polanski or Woody Allen) is important. I don't have a definitive answer. What I know for sure is that I like a lot of Polanski's movies (I've seen most of them). The fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_implantation">false memories</a> can be "easily" implanted in people's memories is intriguing (in the case of Allen, not Polanski). Conclusion: we will probably never know what happened. I don't have much to say about Tamler's and David's top 5, as I've only seen two movies from their list (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689/">Minority Report</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/">The Dark Knight</a>).

The discussion with Jesse Graham sheds some clarity on the "foundations of morality". Graham's work is supposed to be descriptive more than normative, but the frontier between the two is a bit fuzzy and it's hard to be purely descriptive. It's maybe useful to think about those "foundations" as moral intuitions. As far as I am concerned, moral questions should be solved using reason as often as possible, and intuition only when time is very limited.</comments>

    <comments>I'm still not sure what I think about the "six foundations" of morality (care, fairness/proportionality, liberty, loyalty/ingroup, authority/respect, and sanctity/purity). Most of them still looks "nonaxiomatic" to me. I'm certainly more on the liberal side of the spectrum than the conservative side. Maybe even more than Sommers and Pizarro, as I probably don't agree with them about the loyalty/ingroup foundation. It makes sense for family/friends (for psychological reasons), but I fail to see why I should care more about a random citizen in my country than about a random person anywhere on the planet. And, yes, I understand the evolutionary explanation behind in-group loyalty and how it might have made sense from a survival standpoint a long time ago.</comments>

    <comments>Surprising to learn that Eric "suffered through" the Lovesexy tour (because the show was very repetitive, because it started after months of boring rehearsals, etc.), when, from a fan perspective, it's just a fantastic tour. The fact that Eric came from a jazz/R&amp;B background and was not particularly interested in the pop/rock dimension of Prince's music, in particular, but is very grateful of all the opportunities Prince gave him, is refreshing. I like the way Alan and Eric have never been afraid to say positive, as well as negative things about Prince. The parts about the dinner with Miles Davis at Prince's home and Prince listening to Coltrane's "A Love Supreme" on repeat were fun. Also, the background story of the Madhouse albums and Eric's own first two albums, even if largely known, was also nice to hear. It's a shame they didn't talk about "N.E.W.S.", though.</comments>

    <comments>I've always liked what Eric added to Prince's music, especially in 1985-1988. I've never been impressed by what I've heard from him outside of Prince's work, though, so it's kind of weird to hear him talk about all his musical idols (Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Eric Dolphy, Wayne Shorter, James Brown, etc.). He sounds like he really knows his stuff. The only frustrating thing is that Michael &amp; Co. don't seem to ask particularly clever questions. Lots of "wow" and "fan reactions", when Eric is in fact talking about well-known facts. This was also a frustrating thing about the Susan Rogers interview. A bit more research before the interview would have helped. Fortunately, Eric talks a lot. Many fun anecdotes make this interview (which sometimes sounds like a monologue) very enjoyable.</comments>

    <comments>Is the rise of populism (and the election of people such as Trump) caused by more democratic, less elitist societies? What role does technology have when it comes to democracy? Those are intriguing questions. I agree that the "fake news" phenomenon is similar to spam and can probably be fixed, technologically, in a similar way. The "echo chamber" phenomenon is a bit harder to fix, as people are on social networks such as Facebook for fun, not to be challenged. But I have the intuition that it can also be fixed (via psychology, deep learning, etc.). Another factor is the rise of inequalities. Here, I don't completely agree with <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/its-the-people-stupid/">Daniel Miessler</a>: you have to "fix" the people, but you also have to fix (by fine-tuning or radically changing?) the system.</comments>
