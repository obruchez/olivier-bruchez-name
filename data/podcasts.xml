    <comments>The current situation in North Korea is an ethical nightmare. If nobody does anything, million of North Koreans are already starving/suffering. If anybody does anything, we risk a nuclear war and hundreds of thousands or millions of deaths. About Trump: according to Bowden, an impeachment procedure is unlikely and not desirable; the Democrats should focus on finding a good candidate for the next elections.</comments>

    <episode url="http://peachandblack.podbean.com/e/purple-rain-deluxe-review-part-2/">Purple Rain Deluxe Review Part 2</episode>
    <comments>Another long (almost four hours!), fun episode, about the second disc (<i>From The Vault &amp; Previously Unreleased</i>) of the <i>Purple Rain Deluxe</i> release. Again, there are a lot of sound glitches/problems and errors in the liner notes for this disc, but, as Captain would say, "it is what it is". Most of the songs probably come from old cassettes stored at Warner Bros., so this was to be expected. All in all, this is the first official album of previously unreleased music by Prince, so this is an important release.</comments>

    <episode url="https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/triggered" number="87">Triggered - A Conversation with Scott Adams</episode>
    <comments>Scott Adams likes to see the world through filters, patterns, etc. Using an analogy? You've run out of argument. This sometimes leads to lazy, frustrating oversimplifications. Other than that, Scott Adams is intelligent, but he gives a way too charitable interpretation of how Trump operates. I agree with Sam that Trump, more often than not, operates in a "whatever sticks, sticks" mode. He's not using a method. Unless you think the absence of a method is in itself a method. But Scott Adams will always find a way to justify what Trump does, using his "master persuader" filter. As someone said on Reddit, Scott Adams is "setting himself up to always be right". Also, the idea that something can be "not exactly true", but "true enough" (Ã  la Jordan Peterson) or "emotionally true" is really an annoying idea. In the end, I still don't know why Scott Adams defends Trump as much as he does. Is he trying to make people (on the left, especially) see things from a different perspective? Is he trying to sell as many ads on his blog as possible? Is he trying to make his next book as successful as possible? I don't know. It doesn't really make sense.</comments>

    <episode url="https://verybadwizards.fireside.fm/97" number="97">Dogmatic Slumber Party</episode>
    <comments>I'm not sure what to think about the part on Neal deGrasse Tyson's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/neil-degrasse-tyson/reflections-on-rationalia/10154399608556613/">Rationalia</a>. I had never heard/read anything about it before. So, the problem is that governments, politics, and, particularly, politicians suck. What can we do about it? Neal deGrasse Tyson's answer is to "inject" more science, more reason into governments. Yes, this is a bit naive: "The debate then ends quickly in the face of evidence, and we move on to other questions." My conclusion is that the idea, the intention is better than the (proposed) implementation. It's still better to have more reason, more evidence-based thinking, than not. But it won't be enough, as the second part shows: "David and Tamler discuss a recent paper by Dan Kahan and colleagues showing how prone people are to make errors in processing information to favor positions they are predisposed to believe. And even more shocking: the higher your numeracy skills, the more prone you are to fall prey to this bias." That's depressing. We're all biased. So, how do we know what's true and what's not? There's no silver bullet. Intelligent people are wrong. All the time. So we have to keep having civil discussions, with respect, humility, no sense of superiority, etc. And, yes, humor can be seen as a sign of humility (but not always, I would say).</comments>

    <comments>I absolutely <em>love</em> this idea that there are "simple" rules that we find at different scales of reality. The world is complex, but this is somewhat reassuring to know that some basic, underlying principles are simple. That's why I've always loved fractals, I guess. Now, does West's theory work or is he oversimplifying how biology and cities actually work (<a href="https://xkcd.com/793/">mandatory xkcd reference</a>)? <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQT3GP7W8NUFL/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=1594205582">There seems to be some problems with the charts in his book, among other things</a>. Anyway, it's encouraging to hear that some principles can be found at various scales and work <em>at least to some degree</em>. I don't really expect longevity to be <em>stricly</em> linked with the size of an organism, but if there is a relationship between the two <em>on average</em>, then this is already intriguing.</comments>

    <comments>I saw <i>Memento</i> only once, in 2014. I thought it was excellent, but, ironically, I don't remember much about the movie itself... I should watch it again, obviously. What's the relationship between memory and personal identity? Even though we forget things, can we <em>intuitively</em> know/learn them? We constantly "rewrite" our past, consciously or not (e.g. self-deception), because we cannot remember everything. How can we know what's real or not? Can other people also manipulate us like we manipulate ourselves? Those are some of the many questions this movie raises.</comments>

    <episode>Ask Me Anything #8</episode>
    <comments>An episode "for supporters only". Not sure I like the idea. Sam answers my question about how he reads books at 56:00. The answer is not really illuminating. He doesn't really take many notes or organize them in a "rational" way. Basically, he reads on Kindle a lot and relies on his memory (whatever sticks, sticks). I like some of the advice he gave in other parts of the episode: don't be afraid to ask for help, ditch perfectionism (which is the same as fear, for him) and just do things, don't hesitate to change your mind about decisions you made earlier (almost nothing's for life), don't be afraid to <em>not</em> finish books you don't like, don't think too much about the meaning of life (be mindful instead), be as honest as possible (see <i>Lying</i>), etc. Sam doesn't listen much to music (not enough time, cannot work to music). He prefers non-fiction books (I do, too). He doesn't adhere to a strict daily schedule (but he's self-employed, so that's easier to work that way, I guess). He seems to like Aubrey de Grey, so he should really invite him.</comments>

    <episode url="https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/is-this-the-end-of-europe" number="85">Is this the End of Europe? - A Conversation with Douglas Murray</episode>
    <comments>Is Europe commiting suicide by accepting too many immigrants? Should we defend our values more? What are "our values"? To quote a comment on Reddit: "The death of Europe being presented is not about the number of immigrants or the rate of such crimes, it's about the failure of our societies to react appropriately and instead to either acquiesce to, or even simply endorse, abandonment of our core values and moral principles in the name of tolerance and pluralism, no matter the cost." Sensitive topic, of course. The "western values" are not necessarily the "Judeo-Christian values" I often hear about (a weak and divisive concept, to say the least). We're talking about free speech (including the right to criticize religions), women's rights, LGBT rights, etc. It seems clear to me that we have a moral duty to accept as many people that need to flee their country as possible (refugees). It also seems clear to me that immigration has practical impacts, including negative ones. I don't know what the limit should be, but there needs to be one. No practical solutions were discussed in this episode, which is a bit frustrating.</comments>

    <episode url="http://peachandblack.podbean.com/e/purple-rain-deluxe-review-part-1/">Purple Rain Deluxe Review Part 1</episode>
    <comments>This is a review of discs 1 and 3, i.e. the remastered album, as well as the B-sides and edits. Nothing really exciting on these discs. The second part will be about the unreleased tracks (the most interesting part of the set). The remaster is not impressive. It's overcompressed (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war">loudness war</a> on Wikipedia), like all Prince albums since <i>The Gold Experience</i> (1995). There are sound glitches (end of "Let's Go Crazy", start of "Erotic City", etc.). Captain is right to say that it is unforgivable. Overall, a light and fun episode, as always.</comments>

    <comments>John Blackwell is probably my second favorite Prince drummer, after Michael Bland. He died on July 4, 2017. I was not even aware that he played so much with Prince (from 2000 to 2004 and from 2010 to 2013). I saw him live only once, in ZÃ¼rich in 2002. I really like his studio work with Prince (<i>The Rainbow Children</i>, <i>Xpectation</i>, <i>N.E.W.S.</i>, and some of the tracks on <i>Musicology</i>). The Montreux 2009 concerts are also a highlight. I don't have much to say about the episode itself. The anecdotes were fun. The rest of the episode was serious, as expected.</comments>

    <comments>Disgust can be literal (the emotion) or metaphorical (e.g. used in a value judgement). In the second case, we don't really feel disgusted. It's easy to see how disgust has been selected by evolution to protect us against potentially dangerous foods or substances. What's interesting is that there's also a link between disgust, morality, and politics (e.g. liberals are less easily disgusted than conservatives on average). David did <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/david_pizarro_the_strange_politics_of_disgust">a TED talk</a> about this. Interestingly, the presence or absence of a feeling of disgust can even change a person's opinion about morality or politics. Emotions change how we think, even if we don't realize it.</comments>

    <comments>Another episode I didn't retain much from (I don't know why). I've just started reading <i>A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy</i>, so I was under the impression that David and Tamler's description of Stoicism might be a bit incomplete (or even wrong?). Are there really people that can totally suppress their sadness when they lose somebody they love? I'm not sure that's what Stoics were aiming for... Anyway, unsurprisingly, Tamler and I seem to disagree about the importance of emotions (I would describe them as heuristics, in the computer science meaning of the term, leading to quick, but often wrong, "conclusions"), about Peter Singer, etc.</comments>

    <episode url="https://www.samharris.org/podcast/item/landscapes-of-mind" number="84">Landscapes of Mind - A Conversation with Kevin Kelly</episode>
    <comments>I somehow feel that Sam is not too comfortable discussing Kurzweil's ideas. I know that Kurzweil can sound like a religious prophet to some, but I thought that Sam was a bit more nuanced than that. About the dangers of AI (the alignment problem, etc.): I don't agree with Kelly about the fact that "we have time to figure everything out". He keeps repeating that things won't happen overnight, but even if that's the case, it doesn't necessarily mean that we have plenty of time to think about those problems. Also, we'll know that people such as Sam Harris and Elon Musk, who think that we have to be very careful about AI, will have succeeded when, indeed, nothing too bad will have happened. But it's precisely because some people say we have to be very careful that things will go well. It won't mean they're wrong. I'm also disappointed by Kelly's reaction about automation and job losses: he seems to agree with the mainstream idea that we'll always find other tasks to do (I can't see how, unless we merge with machines) and that we can train almost everybody to do something else when a profession (e.g. truck driver) disappears. This is overly optimistic and dangerously wrong. His idea that we should experiment with universal basic income before implementing it at a large scale is also not very useful. Yes, maybe so, but, theoretically, what's the alternative? So, yes, a very disappointing episode. Also, I'd really like to hear Sam discuss the idea of artificial consciousness more. It's a very important topic.</comments>

    <comments>I slowly realized that I had seen the movie they're talking about (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2121382/"><i>Turist</i>, aka <i>Force Majeure</i></a>) more than two years ago. I gave it a rather high score (4 out of 5). So, yes, this is a very good movie. At the time, I probably didn't think of all the themes discussed in this episode (the moral dilemma in the most important scene of the movie, the question of cowardice, instinctive vs conscious character, what can be or cannot be forgiven, what it means to forgive, etc.). Good movies are movies than can be watched several times and trigger rich discussions. I definitely need to watch it again.</comments>

    <episode url="https://verybadwizards.fireside.fm/92" number="92">Jonathan Edwards' Basement</episode>
    <comments>I must have been tired, because most of this episode went over my head. Some emotions (e.g. a white person having a negative reaction when seing a black person) are not necessarily representative of who we are, so, yes, emotions can be dumb (and often are). They tell us more about our (stupid) biases than about what we really believe to be true or good. I liked the first bit about what it means to be offended. How much of a given population needs to be offended for the offense to be "serious enough". One person? 10% 50% More? Do you really need to be offended to say that something is offensive?</comments>

    <comments>A quote from Ali A. Rizvi: "The left is wrong about Islam. The right is wrong about Muslims." Is "telling the truth" the best way to help Muslims reforming their religion? This is a hard question. Sam's goal has never been to help "Muslims on the ground" so different approaches can coexist, e.g. Sam's and Maajid Nawaz'.</comments>

    <comments>I didn't know of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Masih_ad-Dajjal">Al-Masih ad-Dajjal ("the anti-christ")</a> and the role of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_in_Islam">Jesus in Islam</a>. That part was really entertaining. The fact that well-eduated people can become members of ISIS, because they're attracted/motivated by their <em>ideas</em>, not because they're poor, stupid or crazy, is frightening. But it's a reality. Wood reminds us that there aren't that many members of ISIS, though ("only" about 40,000, according to him) and that ISIS is slowly but surely becoming weaker, so it's still a worrying organization, but things will eventually get better. It was also interesting to hear that members of ISIS crave attention and will "gladly" give interviews to journalists (or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Todenh%C3%B6fer">welcome a German journalist to ISIS-controlled territories and let him leave safely</a>).</comments>

Way better than Apollonia 6. So, as usual, the review was fun.</comments>

    <comments>"Should we use algorithms to influence decisions about criminal sentencing or parole decisions?" Yes, we should, as long as the algorithms work. And I agree with David that algorithms <em>can</em> be as good or better than humans at almost any task (and will be better at <em>any</em> task in the near future). The problem is the data you use to feed your machine learning / deep learning algorithms. If your data is "biased", then your algorithm will be biased, so you have to be very careful, especially when the life of people depends on it.</comments>

    <episode url="https://verybadwizards.fireside.fm/90" number="90">Of Mice and Morals</episode>
    <comments>As a vegetarian, I'm slightly "shocked" by the mouse/money experiment mentioned in this episode. At the same time, I'm not shocked at all that we associate different values/prices to different persons, animals, species, etc. This is expected when you introduce a market (i.e. capitalism). What's more interesting is that the value/price you associate with something (e.g. the life of a mouse) goes down when you deal with somebody and goes even lower when you deal with several persons (i.e. when you introduce more and more complex markets). This is not completely surprising. After all, not buying an iPhone won't change the fact that sweatshops exist, because, if you don't buy an iPhone, millions will buy one anyway. In other words, in a market, your moral responsability is somehow attenuated. About the swapping-baby thought experiment: I tend to agree with Tamler here; I'm not sure that it leads to particularly interesting conclusions / useful actions. At the same time, I'm convinced that we should tend as much as possible to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer">Singerian</a> morality. I'm more and more annoyed with this tendency to favor local people, local enterprises, etc. just because it's fashionable. It makes sense in a lot of cases, but not always.</comments>

    <comments>Life is not easy for ex-Muslims. We need more people like Haider. And like Maajid Nawaz, even if he's attacking the problem from a completely different angle. I've always been on the fence about this, but banning the burqa/niqab would probably lead to more isolation for the women having to wear it. I'm still not convinced that openly allowing the burqa/niqab in the public space is a good idea, though. This is a complex issue.</comments>

    <comments>It's useful to remember how people such as Hitler, Stalin, etc. came to power, how the press reacted at the time, how the populations progressively accepted to lose their freedoms without even realizing it, etc. It's a bit frightening. It can sound a bit too hyperbolic at times. But to quote a comment on Reddit: "comparing Trump in 2020 with Hitler in 1945 is ridiculous at this point, but comparing Trump in 2017 with Hitler in 1933, when Hitler wasn't yet a monster but merely an authoritarian, can teach us useful lessons on how to perserve democracy".</comments>

    <comments>I agree with Tamler and David: some people are not clear enough when writing a paper, article, or book And it's not because some fields are <em>really</em> complex and difficult to understand (physics) that you should deliberately use obscure words or concepts to make your field or topic sound more "important" or "serious". I had never really thought about the difference between guilt (more private) and shame (more public), as well as their relationship. Also, it's interesting to think about how shame can be constructively used in public policies, etc. Being anonymous on the internet leads to less shame. That's a problem.</comments>

Ethically, <a href="http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2014/12/should-we-intervene-in-nature-to-help-animals/">should we intervene in nature to help animals?</a> My answer would be "why not?", but as Sam explained, it's not a simple problem (e.g. preventing some animals from being killed might cause the death of other animals, etc.).</comments>

    <comments>A <em>very</em> controversial topic. Again, I'm happy that other people are discussing (toxic) topics such as this one. IQ tests predict something else than just the ability to do IQ tests (i.e. IQ is correlated with many other things). IQ tests don't seem to be biased toward a given culture. Race can be a valid biological concept, but a fuzzy one. You can see race as a kind of extended family. From a genetic point of view, we should probably use the word "population" instead of the (very) charged word "race". According to Murray, the difference between the mean IQ of whites and blacks is significant, but there's a huge overlap between the two bell curves, so you should never discriminate based on that knowledge (that there's a difference in the mean value). So the question remains: why discuss this topic at all? If you say something true, but very controversial/taboo and not very useful, shouldn't you expect the backlash you're getting? I don't think I understood Murray's answer (about positive discrimination, etc.). I had to read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/670yth/73_forbidden_knowledge/dgomv1i/">several comments on Reddit</a> to get an idea of what his position might be. Nevertheless, Murray's motivations don't seem bad. And I agree with Sam that the negative reactions he has received since 1994 are unjustified. In particular, what happened at Middlebury College is completely unacceptable. Finally, Murray's positive position on basic income is interesting, as he's a conservative and it contradicts the idea that people on the left are more in favor of basic income than people on the right.</comments>

    <comments>The small excerpt from a Prince interview at the beginning was nice. Tamler and David explain later in the episode that they're Prince fans (although not hardcore fans, I suspect). What can or should be discussed in philosophy: I tend to disagree with Tamler, here. Everything should be up for discussion. Even (especially!) things that are obvious (to "normal human beings"). Now, that doesn't mean that the book and review they're talking about in that episode are good. Tamler recommends "A History of Western Philosophy" by Bertrand Russel. I bought this book a few years ago. It's on my "to-read" list. I guess I really should read it, but I don't really know how (it's pretty long!). Tamler is not bothered by his finitude. <a href="https://bruchez.blogspot.ch/2016/07/daniel-dennett-les-philosophes-et-les.html">It's not the first time he says that.</a> I guess it explains why we have different positions on some topics (free will, maybe vengeance, etc.). The question of how we should (or can) appreciate the work of Roman Polanski, Woody Allen, or Bill Cosby is discussed again. An important (psychological) difference is whether you see the person in his work or not (e.g. it's impossible to watch "The Cosby Show" without actually seeing Bill Cosby). Is justice in part a substitute for vengeance?</comments>

    <comments>Attention economy is a fascinating topic! It's linked with many other topics: free will, cognitive biases, epistemology, skepticism, fake news, advertisement, psychological manipulation, etc. And, also, in a more indirect way: effective altruism, the <a href="http://olivier.bruchez.name/books#2017-04-30">meaning of life</a>, etc. "What should I do next?" or "How can I best spend my time?" are the most important questions we should ask ourselves. For me, the answer is never "spend 3 hours on Facebook", "play a game on my smartphone for the next 2 hours" or "watch live television". My time is precious and I'm getting more and more serious about how I want to spend it. The fact that people want to make us waste our time is revolting. Facebook and others are guilty of this, of course, but pre-Internet things such as television have been time wasters for a long time. In a completely different domain, I've also refused to serve in the Swiss army (a completely useless organization), for example. Some tools/systems I use to fight time wasters: GTD/to-do lists and reviews, diary/lifelogging, Feedly, lists on Twitter, <a href="http://bengrosser.com/projects/facebook-demetricator/">Demetricator</a> plugin for Facebook, not buying things without thinking about it for some time (e.g. 30 days), etc. An important thing is to become aware of our limitations (what Tristan Harris calls "human architecture"), which include <a href="https://betterhumans.coach.me/cognitive-bias-cheat-sheet-55a472476b18">cognitive biases</a>, among other things, and how people can exploit those limitations. I've only been aware of this since reading <a href="http://olivier.bruchez.name/books#2007-05-08">Petit traitÃ© de manipulation Ã  l'usage des honnÃªtes gens"</a> ten years ago.</comments>

    <comments>Some ideas that stood out for me: 1) The "debate format is a very poor format. It's a rethorical format."; the goal is to convince the audience, not your opponents. 2) Scientists are humans, biased as all other humans, but science is an error-correcting process, so those biases are not really important. The part about quantum mechanics was a nice refresher, but, having already read quite a lot about the topic, I realize that I still don't undertand anything... The last part, about the danger of Christian vs Islamic fundamentalisms, was also interesting in the sense that Harris and Krauss seem to largely agree and, at the same time, arrive at different conclusions.</comments>

    <comments>I had never really thought about the fact that the way a criminal punishment is presented (to criminals, to society), the "story" behind it, its meaning, matters. Community service, for example, is problematic. Do we want to convey the idea, to criminals, to society, that serving our communities is a punishment (i.e. a bad thing)? Of course not, so we have to be careful in how we present this kind of alternative punishments (in that case, in insisting that this is a symbolic way to restitute something to society). About shame: I'm not convinced that it has to be part of punishments.</comments>

    <comments>A few discussions were related to how to do good science and good research. I had already mentioned a book I read 10 years ago, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petit_trait%C3%A9_de_manipulation_%C3%A0_l'usage_des_honn%C3%AAtes_gens">"Petit traitÃ© de manipulation Ã  l'usage des honnÃªtes gens"</a>, which is mostly about priming studies (if I recall correctly) and I already was under the impression that most of those studies probably only indicate a weak effect. So, yes, priming studies are probably a bit "overrated". And often conducted using too few research participants, as many psychological studies. Speaking of "overrated", this probably applies to a lot of neuroscience studies as well, as was discussed with Laurie Santos. The discussion with Sam Harris was good, as usual. The two discussed topics are "old news" to me (artificial intelligence and vegetarianism). I mostly agree with Sam. As did Tamler and David, apparently.</comments>

    <comments>An episode about politics. And again about Trump. I agree with some of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/617mn9/69_the_russia_connection/">comments on Reddit</a>: when it comes to politics, Sam seems to be a little out of his depth. There was nothing really bad about this episode, but nothing really good either. Yes, people such as Harris and Applebaum need to learn how to have better discussions with people who disagree with them. Maybe we need more psychological research in that direction. Some (simplistic) points I retain from this episode: Trumps likes Putin/Russia; in particular, Trump likes how Putin became a politician and used his political power to get even richer; Trump doesn't care about the United States' historical friends/allies; this can have a destabilizing effect on the rest of the world; the constant lies from Trump is something new for the US, but it's a tactic that has already been used many times in other parts of the world.</comments>

    <comments>Part of this episode is about the <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716">"Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science"</a> study from 2015, which attempted "to replicate 100 original studies that had been published in one of three top-tier psychology journals in 2008". "Depending on the criterion used, only 36 to 47% of the original studies were successfully replicated". Good science is hard. Good studies are hard. This is explained at length in Ben Goldacre's two excellent books <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Science_(book)">"Bad Science"</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Pharma">"Bad Pharma"</a>. I guess this is a good thing that psychology is trying to get better as a scientific field. Ever since I read <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petit_trait%C3%A9_de_manipulation_%C3%A0_l'usage_des_honn%C3%AAtes_gens">"Petit traitÃ© de manipulation Ã  l'usage des honnÃªtes gens"</a>, I've been under the impression that psychological studies are usually conducted in universities with 20-30 students as research participants. This is a clichÃ©, of course, but I'm not particularly surprised by the results of the 2015 study. We need more serious studies and we also need <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-analysis">meta-analyses</a> to reach serious conclusions. Maybe we also need more educated researchers, as bad research is probably more often the result of incompetence than fraud (cf <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon's_razor">Hanlon's razor</a>). Other questions that have been discussed: is it moral to lie to children about Santa Claus? is it moral to lie to people in order to conduct a psychological study (which is done on a regular basis)? Personally, I think they have to be understood from a consequentialist standpoint.</comments>

    <comments><p>The introduction about how Sam's "fans" should or should not behave online (e.g. how they should be respectful of all the guests on Sam's podcast, even if their views don't make sense) was a bit weird. But I guess he's right. Discussions should always stay civil and constructive, online or not. The part about how Sam doesn't like ads and how only 1% of his listeners are giving money via Patreon, etc. was more interesting. I hate ads. Listening to the Tim Ferriss Show is painful to me in part because of ads. Currently, I'm giving money to five persons on Patreon. Sam is one of them. I really like this system. I actually wish I could support more people in that way (musicians, bloggers, etc.).</p><p>Harari tends to use words a bit loosely, so, for him, religions and ideologies have the same role from a historical perspective. Sam retorts that religions rely on supernatural claims, whereas ideologies usually rely on natural claims. They then discuss an example I've been thinking about for years: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">technological singularity</a>. Many people see this concept as a "techno-religion" (eternal life, mind uploading, etc.), so I've always been careful not to be too enthusiastic about it. At the same time, it's difficult <em>not</em> to believe that it will happen at some point. I agree that loss of meaning will be one of the hardest challenges to come (e.g. when people won't have to work, at least not as much as they currently have to). The disconnect between what we're "supposed" to do according to evolution and what we'll actually do will get larger with time. Things will probably get weirder. I'm also a bit concerned about virtual reality: I've met several people throughout my life who play video games a lot. Let's just say that I'm far from convinced that this is the best use of your time if you want to become someone interesting...</p></comments>

    <comments>It's impressive that two persons who really disagreed about something (during more than one hour!) can find the time and patience to make a second attempt at a constructive/civil discussion. This is a good example for everybody. A lot of thought-provoking questions are discussed. Can we transcend our genetic/evolutionary predispositions? As was discussed in <a href="http://olivier.bruchez.name/podcasts#2017-03-15">episode 61 of Very Bad Wizards</a>: if a person or a group of persons suffers from a pathology, can she/they still be said to have a meaningful experience? What's the relationship between truth and fiction? Sam's brilliant deep/spiritual/philosophical interpretation of a fish recipe was absolutely funny and at the same time weakened Peterson's position. Yes, there are "truths" to be found in fiction, including religious fictions, but those patterns are to be expected, as our brains all share the same structure, more or less. I still don't understand why Peterson insists that Christianity has a special value/role here. There are "truths" (or illuminating patterns, to be more precise) in almost all works of fiction, good ones (e.g. Dostoyevsky), but also bad ones. This is just a question of interpretation, as was demonstrated by Harris' fish recipe example.</comments>

    <comments>If we feel that our life is meaningful, is it a sufficient condition to say that our life is meaningful? Or are there more objective criteria to determine whether it is meaningful or not? I'm not sure there's any takeaway from this episode. My personal view is that life is "ultimately" meaningless. We will all die. Everybody we know will die. As I wrote in my comments for <a href="http://olivier.bruchez.name/books#2017-02-08">"Life in Light of Death"</a>: "Even if we manage to live longer and/or to upload our minds to machines, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_Earth#Solar_evolution">Earth will be destroyed by the Sun at some point in the future</a>. And even if we manage to move to another planetary system and/or galaxy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_fate_of_the_universe">the universe will most probably die as well</a>." Can life be "locally meaningful" (e.g. as a social construct)? Yes, I think so. If so, is there any objective criterion for "local meaningfulness"? Such as what others think of what we do (our friends, our family, society in general, etc.)? Is it compatible with the fact that <a href="http://olivier.bruchez.name/books#2014-12-23">most of us are actually insignificant and will be completely forgotten in a few generations</a>? As Tamler said, "For every van Gogh, there's a million people who just suck.". The conclusion is that I don't really know how to embrace the fact that I'm both "locally meaningful" and "ultimately insignificant".</comments>

    <comments>The question of how we should approach the work of movie directors, for example, who did questionable things in their life (like Roman Polanski or Woody Allen) is important. I don't have a definitive answer. What I know for sure is that I like a lot of Polanski's movies (I've seen most of them). The fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_implantation">false memories</a> can be "easily" implanted in people's memories is intriguing (in the case of Allen, not Polanski). Conclusion: we will probably never know what happened. I don't have much to say about Tamler's and David's top 5, as I've only seen two movies from their list (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689/">Minority Report</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/">The Dark Knight</a>).

The discussion with Jesse Graham sheds some clarity on the "foundations of morality". Graham's work is supposed to be descriptive more than normative, but the frontier between the two is a bit fuzzy and it's hard to be purely descriptive. It's maybe useful to think about those "foundations" as moral intuitions. As far as I am concerned, moral questions should be solved using reason as often as possible, and intuition only when time is very limited.</comments>

    <comments>I'm still not sure what I think about the "six foundations" of morality (care, fairness/proportionality, liberty, loyalty/ingroup, authority/respect, and sanctity/purity). Most of them still looks "nonaxiomatic" to me. I'm certainly more on the liberal side of the spectrum than the conservative side. Maybe even more than Sommers and Pizarro, as I probably don't agree with them about the loyalty/ingroup foundation. It makes sense for family/friends (for psychological reasons), but I fail to see why I should care more about a random citizen in my country than about a random person anywhere on the planet. And, yes, I understand the evolutionary explanation behind in-group loyalty and how it might have made sense from a survival standpoint a long time ago.</comments>

    <comments>The discussion about the link between disgust and humor, and between disgust and sexuality was somewhat illuminating (mainly because I hadn't really thought about it before). The part about personal identity (e.g. what's more important for personal identity, memories or moral values?) was thought-provoking but too short.</comments>

    <comments>"We are only homo sapiens more or less by accident and we're not going to be them for long." This was a refreshing discussion. Ethics and artificial intelligence are two of my favorite topics. Some very sensitive subtopics were discussed (sex robots, sex toys, paedophilia, beastiality, etc.). The role of empathy and how it can be triggered even with non-humanlike/realistic robots is fascinating.</comments>

    <comments>I'm a bit tired of hearing about Trump or Islam, but some answers were about more original topics (for Harris). I especially liked the parts about the ethics of life extension and his frustrating discussion with Jordan B. Peterson (I like how Harris insists on having a discussion with people, an exchange of ideas, not simply asking questions and superficially reacting to the answers).</comments>

I guess it's intriguing to think that there's more to meditation than what I've experienced from it so far (using Headspace, mainly) - the loss of the sense of self, etc.</comments>

    <comments>Surprising to learn that Eric "suffered through" the Lovesexy tour (because the show was very repetitive, because it started after months of boring rehearsals, etc.), when, from a fan perspective, it's just a fantastic tour. The fact that Eric came from a jazz/R&amp;B background and was not particularly interested in the pop/rock dimension of Prince's music, in particular, but is very grateful of all the opportunities Prince gave him, is refreshing. I like the way Alan and Eric have never been afraid to say positive, as well as negative things about Prince. The parts about the dinner with Miles Davis at Prince's home and Prince listening to Coltrane's "A Love Supreme" on repeat were fun. Also, the background story of the Madhouse albums and Eric's own first two albums, even if largely known, was also nice to hear. It's a shame they didn't talk about "N.E.W.S.", though.</comments>

    <comments>I've always liked what Eric added to Prince's music, especially in 1985-1988. I've never been impressed by what I've heard from him outside of Prince's work, though, so it's kind of weird to hear him talk about all his musical idols (Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Eric Dolphy, Wayne Shorter, James Brown, etc.). He sounds like he really knows his stuff. The only frustrating thing is that Michael &amp; Co. don't seem to ask particularly clever questions. Lots of "wow" and "fan reactions", when Eric is in fact talking about well-known facts. This was also a frustrating thing about the Susan Rogers interview. A bit more research before the interview would have helped. Fortunately, Eric talks a lot. Many fun anecdotes make this interview (which sometimes sounds like a monologue) very enjoyable.</comments>

    <comments>What a weird episode/discussion about epistemology, morality, and (briefly) gender-neutral pronouns. After two hours, I still don't understand Peterson's position. I don't know if that's his fault or Harris'. At this point and after reading some of the comments on Reddit (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/5pbb9o/what_is_true_a_conversation_with_jordan_b_peterson/">"What is True?

    <episode number="38">Democracy, a new era of demagoguery, or just a fluke?</episode>
    <comments>Is the rise of populism (and the election of people such as Trump) caused by more democratic, less elitist societies? What role does technology have when it comes to democracy? Those are intriguing questions. I agree that the "fake news" phenomenon is similar to spam and can probably be fixed, technologically, in a similar way. The "echo chamber" phenomenon is a bit harder to fix, as people are on social networks such as Facebook for fun, not to be challenged. But I have the intuition that it can also be fixed (via psychology, deep learning, etc.). Another factor is the rise of inequalities. Here, I don't completely agree with <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/its-the-people-stupid/">Daniel Miessler</a>: you have to "fix" the people, but you also have to fix (by fine-tuning or radically changing?) the system.</comments>

Instructive exchange about conspiracy theories and fake news: we need more skepticism, as cognitive biases can be dangerous. We have an ethical obligation to help refugees, but at the same time we can't help everybody: this is a hard problem. The situation in the Middle East is the worst Wright has seen in all his life. The discussion about scientology was instructive as well. What a dangerous, powerful, and hence worrying sect!</comments>
