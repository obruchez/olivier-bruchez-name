    <comments>We went back to the Zoological Gardens (Basel Zoo) and the Spielzeug Welten Museum (Toy Worlds Museum), which we visited also with our son more than 5 years ago. He didn't remember it. We also visited the fantastic Yayoi Kusama exhibition at the Fondation Beyeler.</comments>

    <comments>A 2-day trip to Milan. I went there mainly for a KNOWER concert, but I also visited the Cathedral (Duomo), the Teatro alla Scala Museum, the Pinacoteca di Brera, the Museo del Novecento, the Sforzesco Castle courtyards, and the Parco Sempione.</comments>

    <comments>My 3<sup>rd</sup> trip to Québec and 4<sup>th</sup> trip to Canada (5<sup>th</sup>, counting a brief visit of Niagara Falls back in 2001). We visited Montréal, Québec, La Mauricie National Park, the Lake Saint-Jean, Saguenay, and Tadoussac areas. We stayed at two lakeside chalets, which was very nice. We also saw Mike Stern at the Festival International de Jazz de Montréal. I'm still fascinated by the far north areas, which we have never visited - and which probably are more boring in practice than in theory. Still, I'd really like to visit one of those towns in the North part of Québec someday.</comments>

    <comments>A pretty packed trip to Rome, including visits to: the Trevi Fountain, Trastevere, the Colosseum (with the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill), the Pantheon, the Galleria Borghese, the Papal Basilica of Saint Mary Major, the Catacombs of Callixtus (San Callisto), the Vatican (Saint Peter’s Basilica, the Vatican Museums, and the Sistine Chapel), the Palazzo Colonna, and Piazza Navona. We also saw the temporary exhibition "Picasso lo straniero" at the Palazzo Cipolla. This wasn’t planned, but visiting Saint Peter’s Basilica also meant seeing Pope Francis' remains. This was my first trip to Rome since 2004 (Keith Jarrett concert, Colosseum, Vatican Museums, Trevi Fountain, etc.).</comments>

    <comments>A very short stay in the Charmey and Gruyères region. It was the second time I went to the thermal baths of Charmey, the second time I visited the Gruyères Castle and the second time also that I went to the Maison Cailler. The first time I actually visited the inside of the Gruyères Castle was in 2011 and the first time I went to Charmey and the Maison Cailler was in 2017.</comments>

    <comments>Possibly my first time in Zürich since 2009. In the past, I mainly went there to see concerts: Prince in 1998 and 2002, Marcus Miller in 2002 and 2005, Keith Jarrett in 2009. For some reason, we also saw David Copperfield at the Hallenstadion in 2005 (I was not impressed). This time, I particularly liked the Altstadt and the Kunsthaus (Matthew Wong - Vincent Van Gogh exhibition). We also passed by Kaufleuten, the club where I shook Prince's hand in 2002, among other things.</comments>

    <comments>Our 6<sup>th</sup> stay in Leukerbad and our 3<sup>rd</sup> at the Bristol Hotel. We took the Gemmi cable car and did a small hike from the top (there was a lot of snow). We should do a longer hike in the area the next time we go there (e.g. Kandersteg).</comments>

    <comments>My first time in the UK outside of London. We visited Canterbury, Brighton, Portsmouth, Salisbury, Bath, and Oxford. I didn't know anything about most of those places, so that was an enriching trip. Stonehenge was a highlight, but there were many things to like, from cathedrals/abbeys to old warships. I was also pleasantly surprised by the fact that vegetarian/vegan dishes are available in most restaurants. This is not something you see often in Swiss restaurants...</comments>

    <comments>My 3<sup>rd</sup> trip to London. The 1<sup>st</sup> time, in 2003, was to see Keith Jarrett at the Royal Festival Hall. The 2<sup>nd</sup> time, in 2007, was to see Prince at the O2 and at the Indigo2. This time, we didn't see any concert, but we saw a play (<i>The Mousetrap</i>), a musical (<i>Back to the Future: The Musical</i>) and visited three museums (Tate Modern, British Museum, and National Gallery), among other things. That was fun. I will miss the vegetarian/vegan restaurants, like in Berlin.</comments>

    <comments>Turin and Milan both have beautiful areas, but Verona was our favorite place visited during this trip. We'll probably visit it again in the near future. Possibly in spring/autumn, as the temperatures were too high for my taste. Stresa and the Borromean Islands were also very nice, with the advantage of being quite close to where we live (i.e. also an idea for an upcoming weekend).</comments>

    <comments>My 18<sup>th</sup> trip to Berlin (my 4<sup>th</sup> since 2010 actually). This was a trip to mark our 10 years of marriage, as Berlin is a special city for us. We visited the Humboldt Forum for the first time (twice), among other museums. We planned two special diners at a vegetarian (<a href="https://cookiescream.com/">Cookies Cream</a>) and vegan (<a href="https://lucky-leek.com/">Lucky Leek</a>) Michelin restaurants, and visited some of our favorite "normal" restaurants as well (Atame, Samadhi, and Oxymoron). We also biked quite a lot. That was fun.</comments>

    <comments>I might have already visited Schaffhausen, Saint Gall, and the Grisons when I was a child, but I'm not sure. It would have been a very long time ago. Anyway, Switzerland is expensive, but it's also beautiful. We should probably go back to the Grisons once our son is older, so we can hike and bike there.</comments>

We went to the Spielzeug Welten Museum, among other things (walking in the Old Town, crossing the Rhine on small boats, having delicious food at Markthalle, etc.). This certainly won't be our last stay in that nice city.</comments>

    <comments>This was my first trip to Bretagne / Brittany in about 30 years. I didn't swim in the English Channel (La Manche), this time (one story I heard a lot those last 30 years: I apparently was almost taken by strong currents when swimming in La Manche in St-Malo - I didn't realize at the time I could have been in danger). We ate a lot of <i>crêpes</i> (sometimes because it was the easiest way to eat something vegetarian), a lot of pastries (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kouign-amann">kouign-amann</a> and others), and drank a lot of cider. If it wasn't for the non-vegetarian-friendly food (seafood and French cuisine in general), I guess I could live in Brittany. This is a really nice region.</comments>

    <comments>I already visited Oslo in 2002, but this was the first time I visited Northern Norway. We had a lot of luck with the weather (a lot of sun, comfortable temperatures, often around 20 °C). North Cape (Nordkapp) was a bit underwhelming (it's a place "at the end of the world", but it somehow looks fake/artificial). I'm glad we went to Magerøya (the island), though. I really like sparsely populated areas. The Lofoten Islands were absolutely fantastic, of course. I'd like to go back there again, someday, and visit Senja and possibly other islands as well.</comments>

    <pictures url="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bruchez/sets/72157671479966797">Mallorca</pictures>
    <comments>We did a similar trip last year (in Alcúdia, more or less on the same side of the island, 50 minutes away from Cala Mesquida), this time with a 4-month-old baby. The plan was more or less the same: sleep, eat, go to the swimming pool or the beach, read books, etc. This time I finished five books (three of which I had started many weeks ago). I also did a short hike to Talaia de son Jaumell (beautiful view). I think I prefered Cala Mesquida to Alcúdia (more nature, no cars, beautiful beach, mountains, etc.), but the hotel in Alcúdia (PortBlue Club Pollentia Resort &amp; Spa) was probably a bit better than the one in Cala Mesquida (Zafiro Cala Mesquida). Next time, we should really visit the whole island more (with a rented car, possibly).</comments>

    <comments>I had never been to Chicago. It's a nice city (lake, river, buildings, etc.). I particularly liked the Art Institute of Chicago (a fantastic museum!). It was the second time I went to New Orleans and the first time since 2001. This is the city I liked the least among the three. I liked the National WWII Museum, though. It's very well done. Finally, this was the third time I went to New York (after 2001 and 2004). A fantastic city, of course. <i>The</i> city. The Metropolitan Museum of Art is impressive. Probably one of the best museums in the world. The National 9/11 Memorial &amp; Museum was completely different, but very moving and also very well done. It had a special meaning for me, as I first visited New York in September 2001, a few days before 9/11. I will also miss the vegan restaurants. A lot.</comments>

    <comments>A weekend in Adelboden for our 5-year wedding anniversary. We stayed at The Cambrian, a wonderful hotel, with a beautiful view, a spa, an indoor pool, a small outdoor pool (warmer), an excellent restaurant, etc. A very relaxing stay. We visited Thun Castle on our way back.</comments>

    <comments>This is not the kind of trips I'm naturally "attracted" to. We spent seven nights at PortBlue Club Pollentia Resort &amp; Spa. We didn't visit the area. At all. Instead, we slept, ate, went to the swimming pool and to the spa, read books, etc. For six complete days. This was the plan and this is what we did. I finished <i>A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy</i> and started <i>Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow</i>. The last time we did something similar was in 2013, when we went to Fuerteventura.</comments>

    <comments>This was a trip we had wanted to do for several years. It was obviously very different from our trip to Namibia in 2016: big cities (Tokyo, especially), many people (in the subway, in the stations, in the streets), a language (Japanese) we couldn't read, etc.; but it was also quite "exotic", in a different way. This was the cherry blossom season, so nature was still an important dimension of the trip, in a sense, although we mainly visited cities. It was quite a dense trip, which I see as a kind of introduction to a country I had never visited before. We definitely need to go back to Japan someday.</comments>
