    <title url="https://blog.plan99.net/the-science-of-westworld-ec624585e47">The science of Westworld</title>
    <subtitle>A summary of recent artificial intelligence research</subtitle>
    <comments>"A summary of recent artificial intelligence research" using Westworld, one of my favorite shows, as an illustration. This works well and the article touches on some complex topics/issues (intermediate tests towards a more complete Turing test, memory and neural networks, AI control problem, etc.).</comments>

    <title url="https://medium.com/@jitbit/facebook-is-terrifying-8dc4a016b64b">Facebook is terrifying</title>
    <comments>I'm not terrified. Is there anything wrong with me? More seriously, I do have things to hide (my passwords, for one thing), but I'm less concerned than most people about privacy issues.</comments>

    <title url="https://www.letemps.ch/opinions/2017/01/31/economistes-votent-non-rie-iii">Pourquoi des économistes votent non à la RIE III</title>
    <subtitle>Oui, il nous faut une réforme, mais évidemment pas celle-ci. Car la RIE III est bourrée de défauts, incohérente, et potentiellement dangereuse pour l’emploi, estime François Grin, économiste</subtitle>
    <comments>Un article clair, qui semble indiquer que la RIE III est une mauvaise solution. Une source précieuse quelques jours avant les votations fédérales du 12 février 2017.</comments>

    <title url="https://blog.todoist.com/2016/11/03/benefits-of-journaling/">The 15-Minute Habit Worth Making Time For</title>
    <comments>I've been writing a diary since 1993, but it's always refreshing to read about the reasons other people are also journaling. I would just object to calling everything a "journal" when a more precise terminology is available (Getting Things Done, free writing, brainstorming, etc.). Or maybe I'm doing it wrong...</comments>

    <title url="http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20170120-why-paper-is-the-real-killer-app">Why paper is the real 'killer app'</title>
    <subtitle>With apps taking over our lives, there’s a movement afoot as people yearn for simpler, technology-free times.</subtitle>
    <comments>Paper might be a solution for brainstorming and note-taking, but I remain convinced that it's not a good way to organize tasks and projects. Simple online documents win, here.</comments>

    <title url="https://qz.com/892247/dont-set-goals-for-yourself-instead-create-systems-that-make-it-easy-for-you-to-succeed/">Don’t set goals for yourself—instead, create systems that make it easy for you to succeed</title>
    <comments>This is Scott Adams' approach. And also the basis for Getting Things Done (GTD), I guess. The article itself was not particularly illuminating.</comments>

    <title url="http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2017/01/how-to-change-your-personality.html">You (and Your Therapist) Can Change Your Personality</title>
    <comments>We can (somewhat) change our personality, with the help of therapists. I don't really know what to do with this information. I guess it's a source of hope if we don't like some facets of our personalities?</comments>

    <subtitle>Vacuum packs mean meat can stay on shelves for between five and eight days</subtitle>
    <comments>Packaging is apparently very useful for meat and dairy products in particular. Another reason to become vegetarian/vegan?</comments>

    <comments>This reminds me of the concept of extended phenotype by Richard Dawkins, but I'm not convinced it is as useful here.</comments>

	  <subtitle>Why worldview threats undermine evidence</subtitle>
    <comments>Nothing new here: facts often don't convince people. Just like statistics don't convince people, but anecdotes sometimes do. We're all victims of cognitive biases.</comments>

    <title url="http://www.vox.com/2016/7/12/12148938/friendship-adult-challenges-solutions">Why 30 is the decade friends disappear — and what to do about it</title>
    <comments>People get busy with their work and their family. Nothing new, here. I'm not sure the "what to do about it" part of the title has really been addressed by the article. Is the solution really to be less demanding - or something like that?</comments>
