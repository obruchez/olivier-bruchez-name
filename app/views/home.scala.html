    <div class="headline"><h2>Looking for a new job as a software engineer in Lausanne (late 2017-early 2018)</h2></div>

    <p>I've been working at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/">École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)</a> since May 2012, as part of the <a href="https://metamedia.epfl.ch/">Metamedia Center</a>. I've mainly worked on the <a href="https://metamedia.epfl.ch/cms/site/metamedia/lang/en/montreux_jazz_digital_project/about/mjdp">Montreux Jazz Digital Project</a>. My current fixed-term contract will end on February 28, 2018. For various reasons (end of project, budget cuts, etc.), I don't think it's very likely that my contract will be renewed (or at least not for a long period).</p>

    <p>As my manager is fine with me leaving before the end of my contract if an opportunity arises (with a reasonable notice period), I'm already officially looking for a new professional challenge!</p>

    <p>You can read my full <a href="@routes.Application.pdfCv()">CV / résumé</a>, but, basically, I'm a software engineer, working in the Lausanne, Switzerland area. I've been programming almost exclusively in <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> since 2011 and I have used popular Scala-related frameworks such as <a href="https://www.playframework.com/">Play</a>, <a href="http://akka.io/">Akka</a>, <a href="http://slick.lightbend.com/">Slick</a>, etc.</p>

    <p>Over the years, I have acquired a lot of knowledge about audio, video, archiving, etc., as well as developed a personal interest in machine learning, big data, among many other things. I've kept my skills up-to-date by practicing them professionally, of course, but also by reading books and articles, going to meetups, taking online courses (MOOCs), etc.</p>

    <p>My ideal job would be one located in the Lausanne area, full-time or part-time (80%), in a team using a "modern" and/or functional language (Scala, Haskell, Kotlin, Rust, Swift, etc.).</p>

    <p>The easiest way to contact me is by email (<a href="mailto:olivier@@bruchez.org">olivier@@bruchez.org</a>).</p>

    <div class="headline"><h2>About this website</h2></div>

    <p>This site is meant as a central repository for my public lists and documents, which were previously stored on
      Github, Google Drive, etc. It was also an excuse to start a new
      <a href="https://github.com/obruchez/olivier-bruchez-name">programming project</a>, using
      <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>, <a href="https://www.playframework.com/">Play</a>,
      <a href="http://akka.io/">Akka</a>, and more.</p>

    <p>Most of the content on this site is stored on
      <a href="https://github.com/obruchez/olivier-bruchez-name/tree/master/data">Github</a>, but some of it also comes
      from external APIs such as the <a href="https://developers.google.com/blogger/">Blogger API</a> or the
      <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public">Twitter API</a>.</p>

    <div class="headline"><h2>Blog</h2></div>

    <p><a href="https://bruchez.blogspot.com">I have a blog on Blogger</a> since September 2006. It is not completely
      integrated with this website yet, but I'm working on it.</p>

    @defining(posts.latestItems(Posts, count = 5).listItems) { postItems =>
      @if(postItems.nonEmpty) {
        <p>Here are my latest posts:</p>
        <ul class="latestposts">
        @postItems.map { listItem =>
          <li><a href="@listItem.itemUrl">@listItem.date.yyyymmddString</a>: @listItem.shortRepresentation.html</li>
        }
        </ul>
      }
    }

    <div class="headline"><h2>Twitter</h2></div>

    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/obruchez">I'm also on Twitter</a> since February 2008.</p>

    @defining(tweets.latestItems(Tweets, count = 5).listItems) { tweetItems =>

        <p>Here are my latest tweets:</p>

      }
    }

    <div class="headline"><h2>What have I done lately?</h2></div>

    <p>The last books I read, concerts I went to, movies I saw, etc. Yes, I'm a list addict. This is a recurrent theme
      on this site.</p>

    <div class="home-lists">
      @recentActivityListItemsWithPages.grouped(3).map { listItemsWithPagesGroup =>
        <div class="col-md-12">
          @for(column <- 0 to 2) {
            <div class="col-md-4">
              @listItemsWithPagesGroup.lift(column).map { case (listItems, page) =>
                @views.html.listitems(listItems, page)
              }
            </div>
          }
        </div>
      }
    </div>
  </div>
}
